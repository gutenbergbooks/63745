  <h2 id='frwd' class='c012'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c016'>In the fall of the year, the farmers and the
ranchers of the northwest prairies of Canada
release their horses for the winter. Strange as
it may seem to those of us who shudder at the
very thought of raging blizzards on the open
plains, the horses that are left free to roam
over unsheltered space and are obliged to dig
down through feet of snow for their grass, not
only survive the severest winters but are generally
found fat and strong the next spring.</p>

<p class='c003'>If while you are out riding you happen
upon a group of these free horses, they will
stare at you curiously until they begin to fear
that you have come to gather them up and to
take them back to the farm yard, then with
angry, defiant tossing of heads they will turn
and gallop out of reach, going so fast that you
will not see them for snow dust. The horse
you are riding, if he has ever enjoyed a winter
of that freedom, will struggle to get away
from you so that he may join them. Because
you will not let him go, he will show his
displeasure like a petulant child and long after
you have forced him to abandon the attempt to
get loose, long after the happier group has
disappeared, he will keep turning his head
back and calling yearningly to them.</p>

<p class='c003'>The farmer who releases his horses in the
fall rarely loses any of them. Every farmer
knows every horse within a radius of twenty-five
miles or more, knows them by name and
colour, knows their histories and peculiarities.
When the farmer is in doubt as to who some
distant rider may be, you can hear him think
aloud thus:</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s Skinner’s sorrel, Billy. Skinner’s
goin’ for his mail.” Or: “That’s Spicer’s
white nag, Madge. I’ll bet Spicer’s comin’ to
see about them oats.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So in the spring of the year, when the
farmers are all out searching for their horses,
they know those they come upon, and if some
farmer sees Skinner’s sorrel, Billy, he will
drive him in the direction of Skinner’s homestead,
talking to Billy as he does so, in some
such fashion as this:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, Billy, you little devil, you ain’t any
the worse for the worst winter in twenty years.
You’re fat as a pig. Go on now, get home!
I know you don’t like the idea of gettin’ back
to work, but it’s soon seedin’ time, you know!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The farmer who works beside his horses
daily, who gets to understand every expression
of these beautiful, intelligent creatures, always
talks seriously to them. This sounds strange
to us until we have come in contact with these
animals for a short time, when, hardly being
conscious of it, we soon start talking to them
ourselves. They certainly understand many
words and I have seen evidences of horses
recognising at once what sort of temper or
mood men happen to be in as soon as they
approach them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just as they learn to understand us, we learn
to understand them. Every neigh or whinny
takes on the meaning of a word, and their
scowling or angry shaking of heads, and their
protests against certain discomforts we impose
upon them appear as clearly as the similar
expressions of people. The most amazing
fact, however, that slowly dawns upon us,
is the fact that these lovely animals live in a
conscious world of their own, not half so
different from ours as we had allowed ourselves
to think.</p>

<p class='c003'>The rancher is not as intimate with the
horses he breeds and rears in virtual wildness
on the vast ranges which he leases from
the government and about which he builds his
barbed wire fences. Naturally so. He has
from several hundred to several thousand
horses and they are virtually in a wild state
until he sells them, when they are broken-in
and most of the untamed spirit is crushed out
of them by heavy labour.</p>

<p class='c003'>A rancher can rarely tell you how many
horses he has. During the spring when colts
are most often born, his stock may double for
all he knows. He does not attempt to find out
until the fall, when he rounds them up. The
young colts are separated from their mothers
and branded. The poor young things are tied
and thrown and the red hot iron, with the
shape of each rancher’s particular brand, is
pressed upon the shoulder till the insignia is
burned through hair and skin, where the
mark remains as long as the creature lives.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ranch horses are wilder and more spirited
than the farm horses, but when the latter
are released for the winter, they often mix with
the former, breaking up into groups of those
who seem to feel themselves more congenial
to each other. Every animal has a character
and personality of his own, and while he will
get along beautifully with one horse, he will
fight all the time with another. From my
observation, it seems to me that the wild
free horse does much less quarrelling than the
horse that has toiled on the farm, which would
indicate quite clearly how much like ours his
nature is.</p>

<p class='c003'>Very few of the great herds that rustle for
themselves all winter long die while they are
away. Those that die are horses that either
have been kept in the barn too late in the
season or else that were in a starved condition
when they were released. A horse that has
been kept in the barn till after the cold season
has set in and has been inured to the warmth of
the barn, when suddenly exposed to the unsheltered
open plains, if the weather happens to
be severe, will sometimes die because it finds
it is unable to adjust itself to the change in
temperature.</p>

<p class='c003'>But there is one peculiarity of horse nature
which sometimes kills the best horse, not only
in the wilds but in the pasture or barn yard,
if no one is about to come to its assistance.
Every horse loves to roll. He will lie down
on a sandy spot or on the snow and roll over
from side to side. It sometimes happens that
he selects a spot that has a deep rut, or that is
near a wall, a stone, or a straw-stack. He
will roll over and strike the wall or the straw-stack
or get caught in the rut in such a way
that he cannot force himself back. He will
remain helpless on his back till some one comes
to his rescue. If he gets no assistance he will
die in a very short time, sometimes within less
than an hour.</p>

<p class='c003'>But I am interested in the horse as a fellow
being, subject as we are to limitations; and, to
a degree less perhaps than we are, capable of
joy and sorrow. In so far as these beautiful
creatures are able to communicate to others
an indication of the emotions out of which
their lives are built, I have taken my story
directly from them. My story, too, comes
fresh from the prairies. I did most of its
planning while riding on horseback over hundreds
of miles of rolling Alberta plains, often
coming upon hills from which I could see a
perfectly circular horizon without a sign of
human life, save perhaps some telltale arrangement
of stones, laid on the hilltop by Indians
whom fate had long since swept from the
plains of their fatherland. At such times my
pony, whose wild and exciting history forms
the greater part of this story, seemed as much
moved by the open vastness and the stillness
as I; and, each in his own way, we held
communion with the spirit of the wilderness.</p>

ROLLING hills and shallow valleys—an
ocean of brown waves with fast
drying sloughs, like patches of sunshine
on the surface of the sea—such
was the Canadian prairie that autumn
day—such were the miles and miles of Alberta
range, bounded by a barbed wire fence that
was completely lost in the unobstructed play of
sunshine. It was an open wilderness, so vast
that it seemed to stretch on almost endlessly
beyond the horizon, which lay desolate and
unbroken like a rusty, iron ring, girding the
earth. Its immensity, by an inexorable contrast,
dwarfed everything that crept over the
surface of the plains into a helpless puniness.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hundred horses on the range, scattered
and grouped by their predilections for each
other, looked, in the distance, like ants crawling
over the surface of a rock. Within sight
of each other, bound by the ties of race, they
nevertheless had their loves and their preferences.
Most of the mothers with their little
colts grazed in a group by themselves; while
a few mothers, as if they felt that their children
were better than their neighbour’s children,
kept themselves apart from the herd, though
always within sight.</p>

<p class='c003'>Among the latter was a shapely, light-brown
or buckskin mare who was grazing peacefully
about her precious, buckskin coloured daughter.
The little one was asleep on the grass.
Her graceful little legs were stretched as far
as she could stretch them. Her lovely little
head lay flat on the ground. Her fluffy tail
was thrown back on the grass with a delicious
carelessness.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was only six months old, but already
the very image of her mother. From the white
strip on her forehead and the heavy black
mane down to the unequal white spots on her
two hind fetlocks, she was like her. Only
her wiry, delicately wrought little legs seemed
somewhat too long for her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly the old mare’s head went up high
in the air; her grinding teeth ceased grinding
as a broken machine comes to a dead stop; and
the round, dilated, knowing eyes pierced the
slight haze in the atmosphere. The little
head on the grass raised just a bit, looked
inquiringly at her beloved mother—quite
near; then with the innocent confidence of
childhood, dropped back again, rubbing the
soft fragrant grass in an ecstasy of contentment.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the old mare continued to gaze intently,
standing motionless as a stone. She saw that
all the other horses were gazing just as
intently as she was. Small moving objects—two
men on horseback—had broken over the
line of shadow along the southern horizon.
One of them was loping away to the right and
the other to the left. The old buckskin mare
had already lived more than twenty years.
Not only had she herself suffered at the hands
of man, but she had had so many of her babies
taken from her and cruelly abused—often
before her very eyes. Her mother’s heart
began beating fast and apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c003'>The other mares, not far from her, also
showed signs of extreme nervousness. The
buckskin saw them run off for a short distance
as if in panic, then stop and gaze anxiously at
the approaching riders. It was time to act.
She looked questioningly a moment toward
the north; but she realised that that direction
would soon be closed to her, for she could tell
that the riders, loping straight north, meant
to turn in time and come back upon them.</p>

<p class='c003'>She called nervously to her little one. The
little thing sprang to its feet, sidled up to
her and gazed at the dark specks that were
coming together in the north, with fear glowing
moist in her large, round eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Until she had seen a group of horsemen
dismount, one day, she had thought that man
was a monstrous sort of horse with a frightful
hump on its back. What little she had been
able to learn about him since that time had
served only to intensify her fear of him; and
despite her abiding confidence in her mother,
she trembled timorously as she heard the
ominous hoof-beats in the distance.</p>

<p class='c003'>The animals instinctively gathered into a
bunch and started away at full speed. While
one of the horsemen remained some distance
behind, ready to prevent the group from going
off to either side, the other plunged into the
midst of them and deftly separated the mothers
and their colts from the rest of the bunch.
Then they allowed the single horses to run
off to the north at their will; while they came
together behind the mothers and their colts
and drove them southward toward the long
line of shadow that lay like a black elongated
reptile, below the horizon and parallel to it.</p>

<p class='c003'>That long line of shadow, which widened as
they neared it, was a great canyon which the
Red Deer River had cut out of the level plains.
From the jaws of the mouth of the canyon,
which were a mile or so apart, the floor of
the prairies fell away sheer in places, to a
depth of a thousand feet. In many spots there
were several parallel cuts in the edge of that
floor. Where, during the ages, the elements
had been unable to remove the loose earth, it
lay along the bank in steep hills which rose
up from the bottom of the canyon like gigantic
teeth, all crumbling more or less, all dotted
with stones and covered here and there with
blotches of sagebrush and cacti.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the centre of the flat-bottomed canyon, as
if an ancient torrential flood had spent itself
and narrowed down at last to a small, shining
stream, a quarter of a mile in width, ran the
Red Deer River. In the middle of the half-mile
wide space between the river and the hills
that made the wall of the canyon, stood the
buildings of the ranch. The house, a small
shingled structure, stood on the east end of
the spacious, sandy yard; while opposite and
facing it was the long, red barn with its open
door below and the gaping window space in
the loft above. North of the barn and against
its blind wall there was a big corral, divided
into two parts by a partition. The corral
walls as well as the partition were made of
logs laid horizontally, a foot apart and rising
to a height of some eight feet. Each of these
two sections had huge swinging gates which
opened inward.</p>

<p class='c003'>As helplessly as the waters of Niagara, the
frantic mothers, stealing side glances at their
little ones and feeling them at their sides,
poured down the steep incline, between the
giant teeth, into the mouth of the canyon,
slipping, sliding, and leaping downward
riskily, in haste and fear. On the level bottom
of the canyon, the buckskin mare made an
attempt to turn from the path which led to
the rancher’s buildings in the hope of getting
to the river beyond; but one of the horsemen
divined her rebellious intention and shot by
her like a flash of light, heading her off and
forcing her back. She realised the futility of
baffling their superior wills; but went back
with an angry shake of her wise old head and
a deliberate scowl of hatred for the tormenting
man and the servile horse under him who was
betraying his kind.</p>

<p class='c003'>However the old mare happened to feel,
the little buckskin, since the forces of evil had
as yet made no attempt to separate her from
her mother, shook the fear from her heart and
took all the delight there was to take in this
unexpected excitement of the day. Healthy
to the last cell in her body, the race had merely
accelerated the circulation of her blood; and
the ease with which she was able to keep up
with her mother made her conscious of a great
and thrilling power. Her eyes and nostrils
dilated, her mane bristling and her tail
unfurled, her springy legs carrying her with
ease, there was an expression of boundless joy
in the motion of her graceful body.</p>

<p class='c003'>The gates of the corral stood wide open.
Being so driven that they could not swerve
from the path, half the group poured into one
section of the corral and the other half into
the other. When they turned at the opposite
walls realising that there, there was no way
out again, and came back toward the gates,
they saw the men closing them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Only the soul that has been trapped knows
the crushing torment of four relentless walls.
Round and round they went, madly and
stupidly, and clouds of beaten earth rose from
under their feet and choked them. Finally
becoming aware of the fact that the men were
not pursuing them any longer, they packed into
a corner of the corral and, looking over the
corral walls and between the logs, sought to
learn what they were doing. They saw one
man building a fire in the open, but a few
paces from the corral; while the other was
calmly and portentously making preparations
that were only too familiar to the old mares.</p>

<p class='c003'>The little buckskin, beside her mother,
always beside her mother, clinging to that
big beloved body as the soul clings to life,
was wedged into the very corner and right
against the logs of the wall, so that her
frightened eye, in the middle of the open
space between two logs, could see the rancher’s
house some four rods away.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her sides were still throbbing violently
when she saw the house door open. A little
girl appeared. The little filly did not know
what kind of animal that was except that
she guessed that it was some sort of man.
She perceived with renewed trepidation that
the little girl was hopping and skipping
directly toward her. In her fright she pressed
tight against her mother, but her mother, much
more concerned with the men and apparently
indifferent to the little girl, would not move
an inch. When suddenly the little buckskin
felt the touch of the little girl’s hand on her
back, she called out frantically to her mother.
But the old mare bent down her long neck,
touched the little head with her soft, warm
lips, murmured reassuringly and then looked
away again. By that time the filly realised,
uncomfortable though she was, that the little
hand was not going to hurt her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The little girl climbed up two of the logs,
moved slowly toward the little buckskin’s
head, talking softly and coaxingly as she
moved. The filly listened with ears pricked
high. In the stream of meaningless prattle,
the foal became aware of the existence of the
combination of sounds, “Queen,” as one becomes
aware of a constantly repeated melody
in a piece of music. By the time the little
girl had carefully pushed her head through
the space between two logs, directly in front
of the filly’s muzzle, the little buckskin,
though frightened again, became exceedingly
curious. There was something very disarming
about that soft voice and the soothing repetition
of the word, “Queen.” She cautiously
stretched her muzzle, sniffing at the little
mouth, moving it closer and closer and just
when she touched the little girl’s face, with a
cry of delight the little girl kissed her fervently
on the nose.</p>

<p class='c003'>She drew her muzzle away quickly and
looked with a frightened eye. It had interrupted
her attempt to sniff, however, and once
more assured that there was nothing harmful
about the little girl, she made a second attempt.
The little girl continued calling her, “Queen,”
coaxingly, till the little muzzle touched her
lips again and once more she kissed her, crying
out again with delight.</p>

<p class='c003'>This sweet, unofficial christening might have
resulted in a beautiful, enduring friendship,
but a sudden, terrific patter of feet in the next
corral came through the air accompanied by
a nauseating cloud of smoke, and all was
confusion again. Round and round their
section of the corral they swept again till they
realised that the men were not yet molesting
them. When they stopped to investigate, little
Queen saw a man in the other section of the
corral rush toward a mare with a long hideous
stick. She saw him strike the colt that tried
to follow her and saw the colt run back into
the corral while the mother had run out. She
could not quite understand what he was doing;
but she experienced an overwhelming fear of
losing her mother, and clung to her beloved
sides with more tenacity than ever.</p>

<p class='c003'>The other section of the corral was finally
cleared of all the mares who, standing on the
outside, would not go away; but in concert
rent the air with their cries of protest. Queen
was so curious that, despite her beating heart,
she moved to where she could see what was
going on. She saw ropes flash through the
air and immediately after, a little colt fell
to the dusty ground. The cry from the little
one’s mother was answered by a stifled cry
from the ground and as Queen, unable to
stand still for fear, listened to that cry, there
suddenly began coming to her the odour of
blood and burning flesh. Madness seized upon
them once more and the dizzying whirl round
the choking corral gave them some relief.
They finally stopped to rest a while, only to
have another colt thrown and his cries and
the smell of burning flesh set them through the
frenzied motion round the corral, all over
again.</p>

<p class='c003'>Most of the afternoon it took before all the
colts in the first section had been branded and
mutilated. It was a noisy, dusty, cruel process;
and the men, perspiring heavily, their faces
wet and black with the dust that settled on
them, looked like tormenting imps of hell;
but they were no more to be blamed for the
cruelty that was theirs to do than were their
helpless victims.</p>

<p class='c003'>All that clamour of pain and struggle
could not disturb the mist-like loneliness that
brooded over the far-reaching distance. On
the other side of the river, visible beyond
less rugged banks, stretched a lifeless country
of hills and plains, so desolate and so motionless
that the very stones that dotted them
seemed with their feeble reflections to be
futilely protesting against their destitution.</p>

<p class='c003'>A pause came to the torturous struggle. The
gate of the first corral was opened and the
sickened little colts shambled out into the open
where their frantic mothers caressed them,
then led them away to the east. The men
walked off and disappeared in the house.
Taking advantage of the silence and the
respite, the still captive colts, one after
another, took to sucking. It was not very
long, however, before they were interrupted
by the reappearance of the men. The skin
on every captive began to tremble and the
eight mothers with their eight colts packed
into one corner.</p>

<p class='c003'>One man, carrying a long stick, entered the
section and advanced to the middle while the
other stationed himself at the gate. First the
man with the stick forced the group to move
into the opposite corner, then, after a long
struggle, he singled out the buckskin mare.
He had driven her toward the gate but a few
feet, when little Queen, bending so low that
she passed under the stick, rushed out of reach
of it and gained her mother’s side. Had it
not been for the vigilance of the man at the
gate they would have both escaped. It was
getting to be late in the afternoon and the
man was tired and impatient. As with most
impatient people, his common sense gave way
to his impatience. He was not only determined
to get the buckskin mare out first, but he was
even more anxious to punish her. He singled
her out again and reaching her, struck her
with his stick. In pain and fright, the mare
rushed for the gate. It was partially opened
and she was half way out when a cry from
little Queen, who saw her leaving her, brought
her to her senses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Rebelliously, she reared and fell with full
force upon the gate. It swung violently backward,
striking the man who held it so severely
that it knocked him off his feet and sent him
rolling to the wall. The second man who was
trying to prevent Queen from following her
mother was away over at the other end of the
corral. The gateman’s cry and the image of
him on the dusty ground, so confused the other
that for a few moments he stood still, unable
to move a muscle. When he saw his partner
pick himself up, he realised that he should
have hurried to the gate and closed it; but
by that time the whole group had escaped and
were racing for the hills, the buckskin mare
in the lead and her precious Queen eagerly
behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>With a majestic toss of her head, conscious
of having scored a victory, and determined to
keep it, the buckskin mare fled across the flats.
It was now not only the overwhelming desire
to get away. Vaguely she realised that she
had crossed the man’s will and that that was a
punishable offence.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mothers whose foals had been branded
were off on a field at the foot of the hills. The
field had yielded a crop of oats and the oats
had been reaped and taken from the field; but
there was still enough grain left to make it
worth their while to remain there. If, when
they followed the fugitives with their eyes,
they had any desire to go along, they knew
that their sickened colts would not go with
them.</p>

<p class='c003'>The buckskin mare gave them hardly a
glance. She struck up the steep incline with
risky speed, bent upon getting out of the men’s
reach, as soon as was possible. The men, on
the other hand, were at a disadvantage. Before
they could saddle their ponies, the mares, they
knew, would be off somewhere at the other
end of the range. They realised, too, that
the mares were now so excited that they would
have very great difficulty in rounding them
up. They were angry at the rebellious mare,
but these animals were their property and they
did not want to hurt them. Another struggle
at that time, they felt, might even endanger
their own lives. The man who had been
knocked over was not only as tired as the other
fellow was, but he was aching from head to
foot. Besides, the afternoon was rapidly giving
way to early evening. They decided to
finish the branding on the following day.</p>

<p class='c003'>But to the buckskin mare the spaces behind
her seemed peopled with imaginary pursuers,
and she struggled up the slippery incline as
if her very life depended upon getting to the
top and away. The rest of the mares that fled
with her and their little ones seemed to find
greater difficulty in getting to the top, but
they followed as eagerly. Rocks and sand
rolled thunderously down behind them and
the dust rose from the mouth of the canyon
like volcanic smoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they finally reached the level plains
above, the old mare was white with foam.
They had that afternoon been rounded up in
a hollow toward the northeast of where they
now were and fear of being rounded up again
sent the buckskin mare to the west. Her usual
fear of man, many times intensified by the
feeling that now she would be severely
punished for breaking loose, aroused in her
old head the instinctive desire of the animal
that is pursued, to get under cover. Though
there was neither sight nor sound of any one
behind her, she ran with might and main for
the coulee that she knew was a mile and a half
to the west, and until she had turned over the
lip of the coulee and had reached the very
end of its slope, she did not slacken her pace,
several times almost breaking a leg in badger
holes that she avoided by only a hair’s breadth.
Down in the gulch there was a path, made by
the water of the melted snow in spring as it
had wound its way to the river. Along this
path, which led northward, they trotted without
stopping till they came to where the range
fence forced them to halt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here at last they rested, though the buckskin
mare kept anxious vigil for the first sign
of any one pursuing them. The mothers began
grazing slowly while their young, moving
with them, strove to get the milk they felt
belonged to them. As soon as the colts had
had all the milk there was for them they went
leisurely in search of tender grasses and soon
all were grazing as if nothing had ever
happened.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the buckskin mare was still worried.
She walked to the two wires that barred her
way and with her head above the upper wire
she gazed to the north. A quarter of a mile
away, the coulee ended. Its floor curved
upward like the bottom of a ship. Where it
ended and the prairie floor began there was a
cluster of sagebrush. The evening was rapidly
turning the sage into a silhouette against the
bright background of the sky. Fear of pursuit
came back with the coming of the night and
the old mare roused herself. With a sudden
impulse she backed away from the wires and
dropped to her knees. Pushing her head under
the lower wire she moved cautiously forward,
an inch at a time. Slowly she felt the wire
move backward over her body and each time
the barb dug through her skin she stopped
and tried to crouch lower. With a sharp
scratch it rolled over her withers and stuck
painfully into her back. She tried again to
crouch down lower, but failing to rid herself
of the barb, she rested a moment.</p>

<p class='c003'>The barb hurt her considerably and she
made a strenuous effort to lower herself out
of its reach, and in so doing pressed her outstretched
muzzle right into a rosebush. While
the pain of thorns still pricked her lips there
was a sudden flash of white right before her
eyes and a thump on the ground as if a rock had
been thrown at her. With all the strength in
her body, forgetting in her fright the wire on
her back, she sprang backward to her feet,
snapping the lower wire and stretching the
upper one as if it had been a string.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her frightened jump, the momentary struggle
with the upper wire that had caught in
her mane, and the cry that escaped her, set
the group into a stampede, and she herself,
when finally freed from the entangling wire,
dashed off to the rear for a dozen rods. The
slopes of the coulee were dotted with the mares
and colts who had fled in every direction.
Outside the range and on the rim of the coulee
lay a silly rabbit, stretching himself and gazing
down with foolish eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was nothing dangerous visible and
nothing in the air to worry her, so the old mare
started slowly and cautiously back again
toward the one wire now hanging limply, and,
in one place, less than two feet from the
ground. There she sniffed about carefully and
suddenly raising her head, she caught sight of
the rabbit, as he was bounding away.</p>

<p class='c003'>There were many things that the old buckskin
was afraid of, but a rabbit was not one of
them. Realising that she had allowed herself
to become alarmed at nothing, she went at her
task with greater determination. She was
about to get down to her knees again when
she realised that the remaining wire was now
low enough for her to step over it. Carefully
lifting each leg, her skin quivering with her
excitement, the buckskin mare stepped over
the wire into freedom; and little Queen, frightened
to see her mother beyond the fence, made
it with a single leap.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old buckskin was for running now as
fast as she could for the north, but she wanted
the rest of the mares to go with her. She
turned to look at them. There they were
grazing at various points with absolute indifference
to the great achievement she had
consummated. She called to them to follow,
but beyond a busy reply they paid no heed to
her. When, however, they heard the sound
of her tearing the more abundant grass outside
the range, they awoke to the fact that they
were not getting all they might get. Whereas
the ideal of liberty had been an abstraction
to them, the fact of abundant grass was a
reality, and it was not many minutes before,
one by one, they had all made their way over
the hanging wire.</p>

<p class='c003'>The late autumn nights had steadily grown
colder and, since hollows are colder than the
higher portions of the prairie at night, they
moved rapidly to the plains above. Round
about them lay the silent night, dark and
infinite, and the stars looked down upon its
hidden desolation. Closely together they
grazed, lips fairly touching lips, without protest
or impatience. As they grazed, they moved
on to the north, and the rhythmic <i>tear-tear</i> of
grass interspersed with rhythmic footfalls was
the accompanying cadence of their half-unconscious
flight.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some four miles from the range, they slept
for the night on a low round hill and when
dawn came they found the earth covered white
with frost. The sun rose, putting a slight
tinge of red into the whiteness, and Queen was
so curious about it she went looking for the
spots where it was thickest and licked it off
the sage or rosebushes.</p>

<p class='c003'>To warm up they raced for half an hour,
following the old buckskin to the north, then
spent the rest of the morning grazing and
moving leisurely. It was well on toward the
middle of the day when an open triangle of
honking geese, high in the air, made them look
up. The old mare watched the geese move
across the sky till they were lost in the south
and was just about to return to her grazing
when she saw two small objects appear on the
horizon. They were so far away that they
were indiscernible, but she did not wait to
make certain what they were. With a call
that frightened the little herd she turned north
and fled.</p>

<p class='c003'>For several hours they raced on toward the
heart of the wilderness; then complaint on the
part of the little ones, who did not like this
endless running, stopped them. But they had
rested only a few minutes when they discovered
the rancher and his assistant rounding a hill
about two miles behind them. The frantic
mothers, remembering yesterday’s struggle,
fled at top speed, never slackening for a moment
till, nearly twelve miles farther north,
the little ones deliberately hung back. When,
however, half an hour later, their pursuers
surprised them by coming up on top of a hill
only half a mile to their rear, the colts fully
realised the danger and from that time on they
sped along without a murmur.</p>

<p class='c003'>The afternoon wore along toward evening
and though, as the shadows began lengthening,
they felt that their pursuers had abandoned
the pursuit, they did not cease running until
the thickening darkness gave them a greater
feeling of security. Even then their rest was
a nervous one. They grazed with ears pricked
and when they felt that their little ones would
follow they started off again, going at a steady
trot.</p>

<p class='c003'>They came, late in the night, to a hollow
in the middle of which was a huge shadow,
which they recognised was a stack of hay.
There were no lights about anywhere, nor
was there the slightest trace of man in the
air. A cold wind had blown up from the west
and their wet bodies were made uncomfortably
cold. Lying down on the open plains in that
condition, they knew, would not give them
much rest. They felt the need of rest even
more strongly than that of food and the haystack
offered protection against the wind. So
they approached very cautiously.</p>

<p class='c003'>Something white at its base seemed to have
moved as they neared it, and the whole herd
stopped to look and to sniff. The old buckskin
mare, who was now, as she had been all
the time, in the lead, took a few steps farther
and sniffed again. She smelled rotten hay
and with that smell came the smell of warm
bodies of horses. She called out inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c003'>In answer to her call, the white object at
the base of the stack, raised itself laboriously
from the ground and replied with a lazy,
sleepy whinny. Immediately the little herd
started toward the stack. She found the white
object to be a white mare and in the rotten
hay lay her jet black colt, complaining impatiently
because his mother had disturbed him
by getting up, and he felt disagreeably cold.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hay was very old and very rotten, but
they had not come there to feast. What they
wanted was shelter from the hard wind and
each one went looking for a good place to
rest in. The buckskin mare almost stepped
on the leg of an old work-horse. In spite of
her annoying him, he whinnied so good-naturedly
that she decided to stay right there
near him. Queen pushed herself into the hay
beside the old work-horse and her mother lay
down in front of her. Protected against the
wind on all sides she was soon very comfortable
and cosy and fell fast asleep.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi0_8'>
IT was in the very early hours of the
morning when little Queen was rudely
awakened by the sudden rising of her
mother, upon whose warm flank her
little head was lying. As her consciousness
lighted up, she became aware of a
most disturbing odour in the air. Forms of
restless horses moved about in the semi-darkness
and the rhythmic sound of hoof-beats
told of threatening danger. Her mother was
standing next to the white mare in a group that
seemed transfixed by a reddish light which
came from the southwest. In the distance, on
the horizon, was a low crescent of fire. Far
away as the fire was, Queen could see the
flames creeping. It looked very much like a
vast herd of glowing creatures, among which,
now and then, one leaped high above the
others.</p>

<p class='c003'>Terrified so that the very muscles in her
body quivered, she sprang toward her mother
and pushed her way in between the two mares.
Fire had been part of the horrible process in
the corral, but that fire had been as nothing
to this. She was afraid! She wanted to run,
and she worried about their standing still.</p>

<p class='c003'>The black colt on the other side of his white
mother was not the least bit frightened. He
had as yet met with nothing baneful in fires
and they only interested him. At that moment,
having slept well and fed well and feeling
unusually good, he wanted very much to frisk
about and play. He trotted over to Queen
and mischievously butted her from behind,
pushing her half way out from between the
two mares. Queen was much too nervous to
tolerate his playfulness. With an impatient
toss of her head she moved back against her
mother and called for help. The old buckskin
herself was in no mood for trifling and drove
the black colt away with an angry threat. The
white mare, who was as indulgent a mother as
the buckskin, took the matter so seriously that
there would have been trouble but for a sudden
blast of wind, loaded with smoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a hurried clatter of hoofs and
the herd started away as with one impulse.
Down slopes, through wide hollows, up hills,
leaping over badger holes and stones, they
ran, half enjoying the excitement. Occasionally
they stopped to look back with glaring
eyes upon the flames that swept along in their
wake, still far, but unmistakably nearer every
time they stopped.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the coming of full daylight the flames
lost their brilliance and the colts, tired of
running, would stop every once in a while and
noisily protest to their mothers, who kept a
short distance ahead of them. They would
then walk slowly and whinny till a new gust
of wind with a new offensive cloud of smoke
would frighten them and send them on again
with renewed energy.</p>

<p class='c003'>But their endurance was rapidly giving out
and toward the middle of the day they refused
to run any more. Their mothers, a few paces
ahead of them, called to them solicitously, ran
on as if they meant to desert them, then seeing
that that did not move them, they came
back calling coaxingly and tried to encourage
them. A step at a time, their heads bobbing
wearily, their sides wet, they lumbered along
complainingly.</p>

<p class='c003'>The prairie fire kept gaining upon them.
The mothers’ anxiety turned into desperation.
They came back to them and getting behind
them fairly pushed them along. Suddenly a
blazing thistle, driven by the gale, rolled into
their midst. All weariness, all aches and pains
were at once forgotten. As if they were controlled
by a single mind, they bounded forward,
re-entering the race for life with an
energy which they themselves did not know
they had.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sun with smiling indifference moved
rapidly down the lower half of its diurnal arc.
The wind tore along behind them with irregular
force and with a constant changing of direction.
The smoke it had borne all day had
grown less and less perceptible. The weight
of Queen’s body dragged more and more irresistibly
downward. Her head began swimming
in waves of weariness that were inundating
the whole of her body; but she struggled
on bravely, though she vaguely felt that it
would not be long before she would be forced
to give up the struggle. Then, as she reached
the top of a hill, she beheld through the film
of moisture on her eyes, the mares and the
stronger colts who had gone on ahead, now
grazing on the other side of a long, black,
dried mud spot down in the hollow.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the wind had veered decidedly, taking
smell and smoke and fire off to the east, they
had not even noticed. They had been running
unnecessarily for some time, impelled by the
fear of the burning thistle. The sight of the
herd grazing with apparent fearlessness reassured
them. Most of the stragglers walked
on ahead to join them, but Queen selected a
soft spot on the grass and dropped to the
ground with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hunger had no power over her now. She
stretched out her legs and her head and relaxed,
sinking willingly into the stupor that
swept over her. Her mother near her cropped
the delicious grass with avidity; but the long-drawn
sighs that came from her little one and
the rapid sinking and swelling of her wet
sides, worried her. She walked over to
Queen, whinnied softly and licked the perspiration
from her little body. Little Queen
continued to breathe heavily but a note of relief
entered the sound of her breathing, and
now more comfortable she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c003'>But if Queen had gone to sleep thinking that
her exhausting journey was over, she was
doomed to disappointment. She woke shortly
after she had fallen asleep, with a most intense
desire to drink. On the hill above the hollow
she saw the greater part of the herd already
moving on. Some of the mares and their colts
near Queen were starting away and her mother
was calling her, very evidently moved by the
same urge. There was nothing behind them
forcing them to go. There was no discussion
of any sort to make clear the need for going.
In the mind of each of them there was the
image of a slough. It was a sort of composite
image of all the sloughs they had ever drunk
from and with that image like a mirage on the
prairie distance before them, they doggedly
hit once more the unbroken trail to the north.</p>

<p class='c003'>All day and most of the evening they continued
the discouraging advance without coming
even to the bed of a dried-up slough. That
night they grazed a little and slept a little, but
the thirst for water, somewhat weakened by
the coldness of the early night, soon reasserted
itself and sent them restlessly going again.
The morning brought some relief. The
ground was covered with a thick frost and the
grass they ate partially quenched their thirst.
But by the time the sun was quite high on its
arc they were as thirsty as ever and soon commenced
the weary march once more.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was in the early evening that they came
at last upon a half-dried slough toward one
end of which there was a good sized hole full
of water. The surface of the water was covered
with a layer of ice. With her hoof one
of the mares made a large hole in the ice and
as many as could squeeze into the first circle
around it, drank till some of the others began
to fear that there would be no water left for
them. Some pushed the drinkers greedily and
even nipped at them but the others just waited
patiently.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her mother was one of the first to drink,
but little Queen waited till she saw two of the
horses—strangers to her—turn away. The
old work-horse whose good nature had impressed
itself upon her at the haystack, and
who by daylight seemed even more kindly disposed,
his sorrel coat somehow intensifying his
harmlessness, took half the space they left and
Queen walked up beside him. The old fellow’s
upper lip trembled in soft assurance of
his friendship. Very grateful to him Queen
bent down and drank, a few inches away from
his head, keeping her eyes on the reflections
in the water, raising her head hastily just as
soon as one of the reflections moved.</p>

<p class='c003'>The world seemed altogether different to
her after that drink. It seemed as if every
wish of her little soul had been gratified. She
was still tired but it was not a very painful
tiredness and not strong enough to keep her
from preferring the tender grasses in the old
slough to resting.</p>

<p class='c003'>Night came again. The wind completely
changed. It blew strong and cold now from
the southeast. The sky was very clear and in
the north just above the horizon many lights
quivered. The old buckskin mare settled
down comfortably in the midst of the other
mares and little Queen nestled up against her
warm body. With her head upon her mother’s
flank she delighted in her comfort and gazed
at the northern lights, whose brilliant display
did not seem to worry the older horses. Yet
so long as Queen’s eyes were open they were
fastened upon those lights; and so long as the
little brain was awake it kept wondering with
a bit of fear what they might mean, for they
were different from fire yet moved as fire did.</p>

<p class='c003'>She had slept a long time when she was
awakened by the sound of anxious neighing
that seemed far away and yet filled the air
above the little valley. Upon opening her
eyes she beheld the northern lights so clear
and so near that she trembled for fear of them,
and was certain that the disorderly running
about that she heard was due to the same fear.
But when her mother jumped up and she followed,
she discovered that the frightful odour
of fire was coming on the wind from the south,
where she had last seen the flames creeping
behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The same confusion, the same bewildering
excitement and again the wearing race for life
began. That they ran directly toward the
northern lights convinced her that these were
as harmless as the moon and stars. With very
few differences this flight was like the first.
Though the discomfort of it was even more
hateful to her, Queen felt no impending
breakdown and without realising it, she was
stronger now.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dawn came and soon gave way to a somewhat
dull day. The wind changed several times
and finally for a while died down altogether.
There was no trace of smoke in the air; but
the south was now established as a region of
horror and they continued their flight northward
till late in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c003'>They ran down a steep hillside dotted with
many knolls and stones and came into an
elongated, bowl-like valley toward one end of
which there was a small spring lake. There
they stopped to drink, to graze and to rest.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just as the air in that valley bore no trace
of smoke, the plains that stretched away from
that valley bore no trace of man. A few grass-overgrown
buffalo trails led from the lands
above to the deepest part of the ancient lake
and a bleached buffalo skull beside the main
trail told the story of a day and its life that
had passed.</p>

<p class='c003'>A coyote den at the opposite end of the bowl
and half way up the slope gave the only evidence
of life about the lake. The rim of the
bowl shut away the barrenness of the prairies
above. The very dome of heaven rested upon
the rim of that bowl and vast primordial
spaces interposed protection against man’s
greedy intrusions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Little Queen drank some water at the ice
hole, drank the milk that nature had prepared
for her with all the care and concern of her
mother’s love, then slept away another night
at her beloved mother’s side, never even
dreaming that this night was shutting fast
forever the doors behind which lay the closed
first period of her life.</p>

</div>
<div class='c016'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/cap-l.jpg' width='75' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi0_9'>
LITTLE QUEEN was awake at the
very first peep of dawn. With her
soft muzzle pressed against her
mother’s warm flank, she watched the
beautiful unfolding of morning. Red
streaks appeared above the southeastern horizon
and tinted the heavy clouds that were
slowly and ominously coming out of the north
and packing the centre of the sky. The air
was clear and cold. The earth and all things
on it were covered with a thick layer of frost.
Every blade of grass was dressed in fanciful
and luxuriant whiteness. Every hair on her
mother’s body had turned white and thick
save on a small spot on her flank where the
warmth of her little head had driven the frost
away.</p>

<p class='c003'>All around her lay the still forms of mares
and colts and horses. Many of the strangers
had already distinguished themselves from the
others in her mind. The whiteness that covered
them all interested little Queen. She
had seen that whiteness on them before, but
never had she seen them so completely covered
with it.</p>

<p class='c003'>She turned her little head to see whether
her own body was covered with it. The discovery
that it was rather pleased her; but the
lifting of her head resulted in a slight annoyance.
Her lip touched the frost and became
wet and cold. She began to rub the wet lip
on the warm spot of her mother’s flank. Her
mother called sleepily to her as if the movement
bothered her, so she pressed the lip
tight against the warm spot, delighting in its
comfort. In that position she watched the details
of the world about her as they appeared
in the growing light.</p>

<p class='c003'>A short distance before her, beyond two
mares’ backs in front and nearer to her, she
spied the black head of the mischievous colt
only partially covered with frost. He was apparently
still sound asleep. She was gazing
at the two frost-covered ears with uneasiness
and irritation, when suddenly as she raised
her eyes a bit, she saw a coyote come out of
his den way off on the other slope of the valley.
She watched him with fear and absorbed
attention. She remembered having seen one,
once before, somewhere. She remembered too
that her mother had become alarmed at sight
of him and she began to worry as she watched.
She saw that he was interested in the forms
lying about her. She saw him stretch lazily,
yawn and gaze down at them. He trotted away
up to the very rim of the bowl and there he sat
down on his haunches and continued looking
at them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Little Queen lowered her head not to be
conspicuous and continued from that position
to watch his every move. She had been looking
so intently at him that she did not notice
a second coyote only a few paces from the first.
When she did notice it, one of the horses
jumped to his feet, shook the frost from his
body and began running about to warm up.
Another of the horses followed the first and
when little Queen turned to look at them, she
lost sight of the coyotes. She searched for
them on the whiteness, for some time, then
discovered them sitting so still that she had
mistaken them for stones; but the horses that
had got up ran off in their direction and she
saw the two coyotes take to their heels.</p>

<p class='c003'>The manner in which they loped away, continually
looking back as they went, showing
that they were afraid that the horses meant to
run after them, lessened Queen’s fear of them
slightly; and, tired of lying there, she too,
rose to her feet and shook the frost from her
body. Like the big horses she felt that she
wanted exercise so she frisked about her
mother, keeping an eye all the while upon the
black colt who had by this time awakened and
who was now sleepily watching her.</p>

<p class='c003'>But as her blood began to circulate rapidly,
her delight in motion grew apace and in her
delight she forgot the black colt and the coyotes.
The circle about her mother was altogether
too small for the expression of her joy
and she undertook to make a circuit about the
lake with the two other horses that were running.
She had gone only half way when she
became aware of the black colt, racing after
her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She did not see him till she had turned and
as soon as she spied him she sent an urgent
call for help to her mother, and bounded away
with eyes aglow. Her call brought her
mother to her feet. The old mare galloped
away in the opposite direction, intending to
meet her before the black colt got to her. The
excitement roused the last of the sleepers and
soon the air was filled with the thumping of
lively hoofs. Only the old sorrel work-horse
got safely out of the way and went on, indifferent
to the racket, to eat his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c003'>The buckskin mare got to her daughter in
time to prevent the colt from fleeing and
nipped him savagely on the hip. In the meantime
his white mother had reached him and
quite naturally interceded in his behalf. She
made an attempt to nip the buckskin mare, but
backed away in time to avoid two buckskin
legs which had shot into the air. The white
mare then turned quickly around and with her
hind legs replied in kind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The rest of the horses seemed to think it
just the proper fun to accompany morning exercises
and after a few moments of exhilarating
kicking there followed a joyous stampede
resulting at last in their division into smaller
groups, each group in its own corner grazing
away peacefully as if nothing had ever happened.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a preliminary breakfast of milk, little
Queen joined her mother in a profitable search
for the sweetest blades of grass, and grazing
side by side they wandered from the lake
shore, up the slope and away over a level bit
of prairie to another hollow where a slough
had completely dried up, leaving a small, barren,
muddy bottom exposed. The grass was
exceptionally good around that spot and when
little Queen had eaten all she could eat, she
stretched out on the ground in the early afternoon
and slept a long while.</p>

<p class='c003'>She awoke suddenly. She was very cold
and felt that she had been cold for a long time.
A gloomy heaviness hung in the air and the
sky was thick with threatening clouds. All
the desires in her little soul merged into the
one great desire to get to her mother. She
jumped to her feet intending to stretch and rid
the joints of the sleepy feeling, when there
came upon her the fear that she was alone.
She looked anxiously and rapidly in several
directions and then sprang off into space. A
great wave of uneasiness reached up from her
heart and confused her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She had been running around for some time
when she discovered four buckskin legs sticking
up out of a trough-like hollow in the dried
mud. She rushed with fear to her mother who
lay motionless upon her back, either unable
to get up or strangely unwilling to. She was
very glad to see her and much of the fear
that she had just experienced left her at the
very sight of her beloved mother; but she
slowly became conscious of something incomprehensibly
dreadful in the situation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen looked at her curiously and called
half anxiously, half admonishingly, as if to
say, “Why do you lie there like that when I
want you, and want you standing up straight
as one ought to stand?” Receiving no answer
to her calling Queen ceased and gazed at
her with growing terror. There was something
so frightfully unusual about her.
Queen began to shake herself as if she hoped
to shake off the something that seemed to cling
to her and dim and blur everything for her.
She sniffed at the dear old head and sprang
away in terror. There was a pool of blood
near the open mouth and the beloved lips,
always so warm and so soft, were cold and
strangely hard. She became more and more
alarmed and confused. But in her little soul
there was still hope. Her beloved mother,
so capable of solving the hardest problems,
would solve this one. She approached again
and sniffed and sniffed and called and called.
But the more she sniffed and called in vain,
the more intense grew her fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>She raised her little head high and gazed
anxiously away through the thickening gloom.
A last flock of geese was flying south and
the familiar honking which before this had
only aroused her curiosity, now filled her with
foreboding and loneliness. Loneliness was a
state of mind heretofore unknown to her;
but now it brooded over the plains like a
nebulous dragon dropped from some other
world, waiting for an opportunity to devour
her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She walked off slowly and listlessly to
where she had been asleep, intending to while
away the time by grazing until her mother
should wake up; but she could not eat. It
was not many minutes before she was walking
right back again, calling more loudly than
ever. Getting no response, she stood still,
and looked at the body she loved, trying very
hard to understand.</p>

<p class='c003'>All the while the day waned. The sky
grew blacker. The wind blew stronger and
in the air the something that had been threatening
all day seemed to have come nearer.
Grass blades and rosebushes nodded mournfully
over all the lonely earth, and little Queen
imagined, as she turned round and round to
look into every gloomy direction, that the
prairie had become peopled with dangerous
forms who always fled from sight just as she
turned her eyes toward them.</p>

<p class='c003'>She made several attempts to graze; but she
could not eat. A sickening feeling like a
lump in her throat barred the way for food
and she had strangely lost all desire to eat.
At her mother’s side she remained as the long,
fearful moments dragged, sniffing at her occasionally,
calling to her at times in the tone of
one who expects no response and looking off
into the desolate wastes with a half-formed
wish that something would arrive to help her,
yet fearfully worried of what might come.</p>

<p class='c003'>Darkness began lowering more rapidly and
the wind swept over the plains moaning with
disturbing sadness. Little Queen became desperate.
She pushed at her mother with her
nose in passion born of fear, then realising
how useless that effort was, called with all her
strength and ran about her without plan or
purpose.</p>

<p class='c003'>Flakes of snow had been falling now and
then for some time. They began to fall more
rapidly and to choke up the atmosphere,
whirling through it with a sort of light indifference
and cruelly, boastingly foreshadowing
the approach of a more heartless blizzard.
Queen decided at last that there was nothing
for her to do but to lie down beside her cold
mother and to wait for morning. She was
whimperingly lowering herself to the ground
when she caught sight of the skulking form
of a coyote in the gloom to her side and sprang
back upon her feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>Again she began to urge her mother to get
up. She pushed the rock-like side with her
little nose, but she stopped very soon with the
conviction that it was useless and that she
had better keep her eyes on the coyote. She
centred her attention now upon the form that
moved about in the dark grey gloom and discovered
a second form behind the first. In an
effort to move nearer to her mother, she
stepped on the hard side, tripped and fell;
and as she got up to her feet again, there
came out of the boundless horror of the wind-swept
night a blood-curdling howl. Leaping
clearly over her mother’s body she fled from
it, and loped away in the direction of the bowl-like
valley and the lake.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the horses were still grazing near
the lake, as if they realised that a blizzard
was coming and desired to store away in their
bodies all the food they could gather. They
cropped the grass most rapidly as the wind
tore at their tails and manes. Most of the
mares were lying down with their colts and
one horse was drinking at a hole in the ice;
while the old sorrel work-horse stood near him
patiently waiting for his turn at the water.
With an anxious whimper she sidled up to
the old sorrel who replied at once with his
soft, tremulous whinny of good will. When
at last he drank, she cautiously lowered her
head too, and seeing that he had no objections,
she drank as if there were fires in her little
heart that she would quench. When he raised
his head and started away, she pulled her head
out of the water and ran after him as if it had
been her mother that had started away and
was about to leave her behind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old sorrel lumbered off to the spot
where he had slept the night before and Queen
forlornly followed him, stopping several times
as she went to look into the darkness where
she had left her mother and where she still
hoped to find her when the day came again.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old fellow painfully lowered his body,
groaning like a rheumatic old man. Many
years had he toiled in the harness and his limbs
were stiff. Queen waited till he was at rest,
then she approached him humbly and whinnied
questioningly. From the ugly old head
came a soft, barely audible neigh which was
different from that of any horse she had ever
heard. It encouraged and consoled her little
heart with a friendliness without which she
might have died that stormy night.</p>

<p class='c003'>She whimpered like a baby that was cold
and lay down beside him. Then as the wind
annoyed her she moved as near to him as she
could get. There came upon the cold, stinging,
moaning wind another coyote howl, long-drawn,
shrill, mad, and lustful. It seemed far
away but inexpressibly terrifying. Little
Queen raised her trembling head. The old
sorrel pricked his ears. But she saw the big
pointed ears go back into place again and the
big shadowy head take its former sleepy position.
He was not afraid, she was glad of that;
but she was afraid. Strange images, visions
she sought to drive from her mind by closing
her eyes, tormented her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was lying right against his back.
Slowly she lowered her head upon his neck,
testing his willingness by degrees. When her
head was finally resting fully on his neck, he
only whinnied softly, and Queen tried her best
to reply gratefully. A feeling of ineffable
gratitude swept over her with the warmth of
his body.</p>

<p class='c003'>All through the night she thought of her
mother, when awake, and dreamed of her
when asleep. A thousand times she broke
from her light snatches of slumber, from her
horrible dreams of coyotes, to pierce the storm-filled
gloom with her terrified eyes, expecting
hopefully to find her mother standing over
her and looking down upon her; but only the
emptiness of the night, obliterating the world
she had known, shrieked with an uncertainty
that filled up her soul.</p>

IT is only the foolish who bewail the
inevitable with wasting passion; it
is after all the wise who accept it and
make the most of things. Because
the inevitable is so much more the ruling
force in animal life, animals adjust themselves
more quickly to new conditions.
Conceited man attributes that early adjustment
to a lack of feeling. Yet when little
Queen awoke on the first morning of her
orphanage, there had already come into her
eyes and upon her head a perceptible sadness,
the sadness of resignation.</p>

<p class='c003'>A great change had come over the world
in that single night and so different did it
seem from what she had known it to be, that
as far as she could think, the night might have
been a space of years; that years might have
elapsed since her mother, who hitherto had
always warmed and fed and protected her, now
had ceased to warm and feed and protect her.</p>

<p class='c003'>How white the world was! The little white
flakes that had fluttered about in the air at
nightfall had covered up all things with a
heavier whiteness than that of any frosty
morning in her experience. And she expected
that with the coming of the warmth of day
it would all disappear. Yesterday it had
taken the forms of the things it had covered,
this morning only the heads of the horses
stuck up out of the drifts of it; while stones
and coyote dens had been completely wiped
out of existence. Her own feet were out of
sight. She jumped up to see whether it would
interfere with her jumping up, and was glad
to note how easily it was shaken from her body.
She took a few steps, discovered that it was
disagreeable to wade through and stopped.
On the white rim of the bowl stood a flock
of prairie chickens as if they had been discussing
the great change. She watched them
half interestedly. They were birds, and birds
were not to be feared. She looked over them
and beyond them. There, somewhere, she felt
was her mother. She took a hasty step in that
direction and stopped again. She was afraid
to go.</p>

<p class='c003'>She lowered her head and listlessly tasted
some of the snow. It was not food, she knew
that at once; and it turned into water in her
mouth. One wants water badly when one
wants it, but one cannot live on water. How
was one to eat when there was no grass in sight
and no mother about with the more substantial
milk? She looked and looked away over the
whiteness till her eyes, taxed by its reflection,
ceased seeing altogether for a few minutes.
But as soon as she could see once more, Queen
began to search for her mother and this search,
each succeeding day with less hope and enthusiasm,
she never wholly abandoned. She
sniffed at every mare about her, calling plaintively
and knowing her mistake in the indifference
with which some of them listened to
her appeal or the annoyance which others
were too ready to show.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old sorrel got up at last and shook the
snow from his back. She watched it falling
in showers of white dust and through the sides
of her eyes she saw a number of other horses
do as he had done. She saw him take big
bites of snow and shake his head quickly as
he did so, so she too ate some more of it and
shook her head up and down. When he lumbered
away, sinking into the deep drifts as
he went, she followed him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Off on the slope horses were energetically
pawing the snow and Queen wondered what
they were doing. When the old sorrel, somewhat
clumsily, beat the snow with his heavy
front foot, she watched him curiously. She
saw him laboriously expose the brown grass
underneath and the sight of the grass relieved
her, for she had been worrying about its disappearance.
Though the snow was still
packed in between the blades, he cropped up
the grass just as soon as it appeared. She
then watched for the next bit to appear and
tried to get a bite before he had it all. She
succeeded in getting only a few blades and
since he did not seem to mind it, she tried to
be quicker next time. She did get a mouthful
occasionally but it was not enough for her
appetite and it finally dawned on her that she
ought to work for herself. She pawed the
snow very close to him and as soon as she spied
him eating, she would seize as much of the
grass he had uncovered as she could, then
quickly go back to her own.</p>

<p class='c003'>A hundred times that morning she wearied
of pawing snow, and each time her head
would raise and she would look wistfully off
into space with the irrepressible impulse to go
looking for her mother; but she did not know
which way to go. In every respect, in every
aspect, her life and the earth had changed in
the night. When, as she looked, it seemed to
her that a certain direction was the right one,
she would think of the coyotes and fear would
extinguish the impulse. She made several
attempts to get the old sorrel to go with her.
She would start off in what appeared to her
the right direction, and walking a few paces
would stop and call to him. He would pay no
attention to her for a while; then as if to stop
her calling, he would walk over to where she
was and begin to paw the snow there. But
it took so much energy and so much time to
get him over each bit of space, that she made
little headway; and when darkness began
dulling the whiteness, her fear of the coyotes
who seemed to people the shadows became
so intense, she did not dare to leave the sorrel
even to the extent of a few paces.</p>

<p class='c003'>Several very sad, dull days went by. Then
came a day during which the sun shone for a
while and made her feel better. But it melted
the surface of the snow and the cold evening
froze it into ice. The struggle for grass became
harder and her constant slipping made
life very disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c003'>She saw the black colt now and then.
Though he was livelier and far more happy
than she, he made no attempts to molest her.
Tolerance characterised every move of every
member of the herd. The rigours of the sudden
winter seemed to strengthen the racial
bonds of these good-natured creatures. Each
one went his plodding way, thankful for the
silent companionship of the herd and showing
his appreciation by refraining from any offence
to his neighbour.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen clung to the old sorrel though she
did not thrive on his passive fosterage. She
was losing weight rapidly. Her eyes dulled,
her head began hanging low and even her
long winter hair could not fill in the hollows
between her ribs.</p>

<p class='c003'>In pawing snow she found that her
strength was not equal to the desire for food;
and, resting often, she was almost always hungry.
As she became weaker from day to day,
she became more and more unhappy, and
longed more and more intensely for her
mother, who was nevertheless growing dimmer
and more distant in her mind.</p>

<p class='c003'>There came a grey day. A north wind
whistled over the hard crust on the snow and
loaded, black clouds dropped more white
flakes with listless irregularity. Something
pervaded the air of this day which was so
similar to the day when she had lost her
mother that she became irresistibly restless.
All day this restlessness made it hard for her
to dig. Late in the afternoon she started
away with a suddenness that she herself
could not understand. Up the slope and over
the plains she went, sinking into deep drifts,
pulling out again and going on without a
pause, pursuing the image of her beautiful
mother that had suddenly lighted up in her
soul and as suddenly gone out again, before
she could touch it. Somewhere in the dismal
swirl it was and she struggled bravely but
blindly after it, calling in vain as she went.</p>

<p class='c003'>For fully an hour she plodded through
snows that were piling up a foot above the
harder crust, slipping, bruising herself on the
jagged ice, resting when she could not go on
any farther and coming at last to an understanding
that she had been madly pursuing
nothing, that she was lost, and that she wanted
the protection of the old sorrel. She called to
him again and again before she stopped to
listen for a reply and suddenly became aware
of an agreeable sound floating on the wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>She called again striking out meanwhile in
the direction from which she instinctively felt
the sound had come. Night was close at
hand. The light that was still left was weakened
by the showers of snow flakes that now
fell rapidly and without interruption. Again
it seemed to her she heard a reply. She spent
more energy in calling than she did in pushing
on, occasionally falling into a deep drift and
remaining there for some time before she
made an effort to extricate herself. Who it
was answering her in the fast darkening night,
she did not know. All she knew and felt with
every living cell of her being was that in the
cold desolation that was submerging her, the
thing that was answering her could save her
from the unthinkable horror of being alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her strength ebbed fast from her limbs,
only the steadily nearing whinny made her last
efforts possible. Then suddenly, much sooner
than she expected it, a black object appeared
in the darkened snows before her. The last
whinny was more distinct than any of the
others. Before her, struggling toward her as
she had been struggling toward him, was the
black colt. If Queen had had any strength
left, she would have bounded off to the side;
but she could not move.</p>

<p class='c003'>It did not take her long, however, to learn
that the black colt had not come to molest
her. Where he had been, how he came there,
or that he might all this time have been following
her, did not concern her. His whinny
was most conciliating and in the warmth of
his body was comfort and salvation. He was
almost as completely worn out as she was.
She rallied enough strength to kick the snow
from her legs so that she could lie down.
Whinnying all the while, he cleared a space
beside her and there they spent the howling
night.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was somewhere about the middle of the
next day before the cutting wind subsided and
the snow ceased falling. The black colt who
was completely covered with snow, broke out
first and Queen followed him at once. They
had not gone more than a few yards when they
saw the head of the white mare rise above the
rim of the bowl-like valley. As soon as she
spied her colt the white mare began to neigh
eagerly, her piercing call echoing from the
hills and bringing her the baby response that
thrilled her out of patience. Snorting and
puffing she plowed the deep snow which fell
away from her like spray from the keel of a
ship.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she reached him at last, she caressed
him with tremulous lips, running them along
his little forehead, between the two small ears,
and down his mane and back. Caresses make
life worth while, but they have their time and
their use and the black colt was hungry. He
struck out at once for his milk. But his
mother had whinnied for him all through the
long dark night and her excitement at having
found him again was so great she hardly knew
what she was doing. He slipped from her
caresses. Her lips craved the touch of him.
Little Queen had come with him out of the
unknown where she had feared he had been
swallowed up. So it happened that her exuberant
caresses fell partly upon little Queen.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was like having refound her mother to
Queen. Changed, yes; but life is all change!
She switched her little tail and danced about
the white mare, finally sliding along her other
side and reaching out and seizing the second
dug. The black colt, little Queen’s erstwhile
tormentor, touched noses with her as she
drank, and shared his milk with her without
the slightest sign of objection.</p>

<p class='c003'>No figures affected his philanthropy. Fractions,
division, these abstractions never entered
the sphere of his mind. The philosophy
of that period of his life may be summed
up in the precept: “Drink all there is to
drink, all you happen to find, and if still hungry,
eat grass and try again later.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Every time he went for his milk, Queen took
the other side as if she had never known another
mother. Though the white mare often
showed a natural predilection for her son, she
adopted little Queen because no thought presented
itself to her mind against tolerating
her, especially since she and her little son
had become inseparable.</p>

<p class='c003'>They played together, rested side by side,
drank and thrived together; and so over little
Queen’s grievous orphanage rose the sun of
a happier youth.</p>

THE winter was a hard one. The skies
were persistently and monotonously
dull. A few moments of sunshine
were invariably followed by days of
howling winds and leaden skies.
Blizzard succeeded blizzard and the hollows
filled so full of snow that it became dangerous
for colts to wander off alone and they
clung to their mothers’ sides.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the short periods of daylight, the
horses, the mares, and the colts broke up into
groups and wandered away as far as the deeps
allowed or hunger urged; but each night they
congregated in the same corner of the valley.
This nightly congregating kept the snow in
one big spot firmly trodden to the ground and
raised two walls with the rest of it, in the lee
of which they obtained the comforts of an airy
barn.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many a night when the shrieking wind overhead
poured shower after shower of dry snow
over them, covering them as with a blanket,
little Queen, lying close to the black colt and
his white mother, indulged in a happy gratefulness
for the comforts she experienced.
Where man thinks and knows, animals feel.
Experience had taught her in sensations and
emotions, which she had not forgotten, what
discomfort and disagreeableness were. The
change in conditions which she now experienced
brought into her mind sensations of
a gratefulness which expressed itself in an
ardent love for the colt and the white mare, a
love which slowly overflowed toward and encompassed
all the horses of the herd.</p>

<p class='c003'>The nights were very long. The sun rose
and set so far to the south and the arc it made
in its daily course was so small that a drink or
two of her share of the black colt’s milk and
the procuring of a single meal on the deep,
hidden grass, spent the day. When the
shadows of one night, driven out by the dawn,
came back so soon in the next night and there
was nothing to do but sleep, sleeping became
tiresome, and the necessary shifting from side
to side kept the mind awake and active. Impressions
made and forgotten rekindled like
embers in the windblown ashes of a fire.
These impressions, varied as they were, and
so largely without order of time or place,
were nevertheless as useful to her as experience
is useful to us. It was out of this
experience that she built the individuality of
her character, and only those who are totally
ignorant of animalkind can deny that they have
character and individuality.</p>

<p class='c003'>Often the phantom form of the old buckskin
mare came to haunt the dreams of little Queen
and always on the following day she pawed the
snow less energetically and gazed wistfully
away over the endless prairie snows, puzzled
over the incongruity of her mother’s coming
in the dark hours and never by daylight when
she could enjoy her most.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was comfortable and happy in her second
fosterage and thrived well upon it; yet
these persistent dreams of her nights haunted
her wakeful days and in time left on her beautiful
head marks of sorrow, vague and intangible,
but unmistakably there, adding a charm
to that head that it never lost.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then the days began lengthening. The sun
climbed higher in the sky and broke through
the spell of winter’s clouds with a smiling
kindness that stirred every cell in Queen’s
body. Spring came upon the stern winter as
a rosy dawn breaks upon an unpleasant night.
The white-packed hollows began smiling to
cloudless skies with a silent and radiating wetness
and the snows shrank away, exposing
brown spots. The earth began to emit intoxicating
odours of growth and the valleys filled
with cool, trembling water. Like living
things born in the night these rippling pools
appeared everywhere.</p>

<p class='c003'>Birds came daily in greater numbers from
the south and their songs augmented the nameless
urge that the south winds bore and filled
the desolate wilds with friendliness and goodwill.
Before the snows had completely disappeared,
a layer of thick green grass began
carpeting the earth and myriads of delicate
crocuses studded the green with colour-illumined
stars.</p>

<p class='c003'>Long as the days were becoming, the colts
found them all too short for the full expression
of the joy that spring was giving them. Nights
came altogether too soon and the vapoury light
of early dawn revealed them already romping
over the plains, seeking to rid their joints of
the sleepy feeling that the long winter had
given them. In wide circles they ran, plunging
through sloughs, jumping, kicking at the
air, pretending to bite each other in violent
anger, stopping only when hunger demanded
it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Changes met them wherever they looked.
The earth itself and all life upon it seemed to
have become an endless play of the forces of
change. Just as each day was in itself a succession
of changes, white light merging into
the tinted colours of evening, fading out in
night and breaking again into the colours and
the light of a new day, so one day was different
from another and they felt themselves each
day changing from what they had been the
day before.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen was only vaguely conscious of these
changes in herself, and in her companions, but
one change was clearest of all. Most easily
perceptible of all, this change, in a way, represented
them all. It was the change which
she one day realised was taking place in the
black colt. Something was very apparently
happening to him. His black hair fell rapidly,
as she had realised her own hair was
falling; but the black colt was steadily growing
less black, turning white as night turns to
day. When he was white enough to startle
her, she realised that henceforth he was to be
white as his mother was. So distracting was
this change, however, that she sometimes
looked at him with the feeling that he was
another colt, and in those rare moments she
experienced a peculiar depressive emotion,
like the feeling she had experienced when she
was standing before her dead mother, looking
confusedly down upon her. Yet she knew that
it was he. There were fortunately other characteristics
that remained unchanged. In time,
of course, she got quite used to the change in
his appearance; but she never forgot that he
had been black. The image of him, the picture
that rose in her mind when she thought of
him and when he was not immediately before
her, was a changeable image which was black
one moment and white the next.</p>

<p class='c003'>If Queen had been in the habit of applying
to every image in her mind some name, she
would have called him, “White-black.”
Possibly she might have added the word or
the idea, “big,” for he was much bigger than
he had been; but, since that quality applied
to all the colts, she would probably have left
that off.</p>

<p class='c003'>By the varying degrees of this quality in
the many colts, as well as by the many other
qualities she learned belonged to all or to each
of them, Queen knew one from the other.
All through the long winter her companionship
had been restricted to the black colt and
his mother, but now, the common desires of
youth brought the colts together and led them
in time to abandon the companionship of the
mares and the adult horses. Some of them
went back every day to their mothers for milk,
but they all played by themselves and even
at night they rested in a group together, away
from their mothers. Though their mothers
had their own social life and activities to occupy
them and did not mind the daily absence
of their overgrown foals, their maternal instincts,
their anxiety over their erstwhile
babies, was still very great. In spite of this
division of interests, in spite of this habitual
grouping, they lived near each other and at
the first sound or sign of danger, they gathered
and fled in concert.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old desire for her mother, the longing,
the urge to go forth and to seek, had lost what
little definiteness it had had and had turned
into an impulse to go, which spasmodically
welled up in Queen and sent her loping over
the plains without purpose. Always as soon
as he saw her start away, White-black loped
after her and always the rest of the colts followed.
Sometimes the older horses and
mares, mistaking the escapade for a sign of
danger, would lope after them.</p>

<p class='c003'>First happening occasionally, this game began
to take place daily and even several times
a day. Just as the colts and other horses got
into the habit of following her, Queen acquired
the habitual desire to be followed.</p>

<p class='c003'>It happened one morning that the big
brown colt led the race. Jealousy seized at
the heart and mind of Queen and she exerted
herself to the very end of her strength to get
ahead of him, as if her life depended upon
doing so. She puffed and snorted and pumped
away with her thin long legs, but could not even
get abreast of him. Behind her she could hear
the milder snorting of White-black. Suddenly
she veered to the left. She was exhausted
and intended getting out of the way
of the herd; but she felt White-black veering
with her and knew that the others were following
him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Quickly she seized the opportunity. She
exerted herself with renewed hope and sped
on harder than ever and soon the brown colt
found himself alone. To the left was the
whole herd racing madly after Queen, in an
ecstasy of motion. He turned and followed
them, trying hard to catch up, but realising
that he had lost. On the other hand Queen
had discovered a trick whereby the newly acquired
leadership could be kept, and she
meant to keep it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their food grew in abundance wherever
they turned. The grass was rich and juicy;
wild plants, sweet and delightful to the taste,
grew abundantly on the hillsides; and water,
cool and refreshing, trembled in every hollow.</p>

<p class='c003'>Plenty to eat and a great deal of exercise
to sharpen the appetite filled out all the depressions
in Queen’s body and because she
was too active to be fat, she became delightfully
plump. Her hair now shorter was sleek
and its gloss flashed in the sunlight. Her
mane was luxuriantly thick and wavy. Part
of it came down between her ears and over
the white spot on her forehead, down to her
eyes, giving her magnificent head, with the
imprint of sadness upon it, a touch of queenliness
that few queens possess.</p>

<p class='c003'>We all love beauty without being able to
say just what it is. The colts felt a something
about her which aroused in them a sort
of homage, spontaneous and unquestioned.
White-black, strong and good-natured, kept
the other colts at a safe distance; but they
availed themselves of every chance to touch
her, to graze where she was grazing or to run
alongside of her. Sometimes White-black resented
the attention some big fellow offered
and started a quarrel which resulted in his
defeat. At such times he would assume the attitude
of one who had been convinced of being
wrong. After all he was yet too young to be
serious in his love affairs and his affection for
Queen was due more to their having been
reared together than to anything else.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen loved them all, but she loved White-black
most and every colt knew it. Many a
quarrel ended in his victory because of her
attitude rather than his strength, but he did
not know that. Next to him Queen favoured
the white mare and next to her, the old sorrel
work-horse. White-black understood her love
for his mother; but he could not fathom her
predilection for the old horse. For a long
time, when the old sorrel out of pure reminiscent
fondness approached Queen, White-black
would lose his temper, kick at the old
horse and attempt to bite him; but where
Queen sometimes allowed the colts to fight it
out between themselves, she invariably interfered
in any attempt to wrangle with the sorrel
by taking part in it on his side. In time,
White-black learned to let him alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>The lull of the summer began to creep into
the long days, and mosquitoes and nose-flies
in vast numbers came to blight the sweetness
of the spring wilds. The mosquitoes, annoying
as these bloody little pests were, were not
half so bad as the nose-flies. The very sight of
their long beaks and yellow backs would drive
the colts frantic. Grazing quietly, they would
suddenly begin bobbing their heads up and
down and then start away over the plains as
if something frightful were after them.</p>

<p class='c003'>This murderous pest always started an attack
by buzzing around the nose like a bee,
then landing on the breast it would creep up
the neck till it reached the muzzle, where it
would quietly settle down. Puncturing a hole
in the tender nose, it would insert its beak
and drink freely and unshakeably, then fly
away leaving a hurt that burned for hours.
When they first appeared, the older horses,
knowing them, would keep their noses in the
grass as they grazed, or they would, when
through grazing, gather in groups and rest
their chins firmly upon each other’s backs,
thus giving the pest no chance to creep up.
In time the colts learned to protect themselves
in the same way.</p>

<p class='c003'>When sultry spells were suddenly broken by
gusts of unbridled winds, which would carry
the pests away, the colts would give themselves
over to eating and drinking and merrymaking.</p>

<p class='c003'>There came a sultry spell in the early days
of summer. Every chin was resting upon
some friend’s back. Tails switched ceaselessly
and feet stamped the ground with
drowsy rhythm. The air was still. Not
a blade of grass moved. The silence was
broken only by the nauseous singing of
mosquitoes and the monotonous droning of
nose-flies.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly there came upon the still, warm
air the tattoo of distant hoof-beats. Two
horsemen, coming up over a hill to the south,
were just in the act of separating with the
obvious intention of coming together on the
other side of them, when Queen discovered
them. Instantly the group broke up, and
colts and mares and horses mixed in a noisy
stampede.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the older horses wearied of the race,
they stopped to look back anxiously at the
pursuing riders; but Queen, in whom the fear
of man, dormant all winter, had now awakened
with great intensity, tore away to the
north, snorting as she went, her tail at an angle
behind her, loping as fast as she could despite
the heat and the insects.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came breathlessly to the summit of a
rather high hill and turned to look back.
Some of the colts and some of the faster adults
were there with her, but the white mare and
the old sorrel were not there. Half a mile
behind them she could see the riders, now
facing south; and beyond them she saw the
part of the herd which they had captured.</p>

<p class='c003'>White-black was standing beside Queen
when he suddenly discovered the loss of his
mother. Neighing loudly and distractedly, he
started down the hill after the men. Queen
was afraid to go with him, yet she did not
want to let him go alone. She followed him,
calling to him as she went; but White-black
persisted. When they got within a quarter
of a mile of the men, they saw one of them
turn off to the side and then turn backward.
White-black then realised the danger of continuing
after them. Judging by horses he
had known, horses reared in barnyards, the
man thought that it would be a simple matter
to get the rest of them, now that he had captured
some of them; but he was mistaken.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was anything but a simple matter. Queen
stopped so short that one of the colts, following
along behind, hurt himself, running into her.
With a stamp of her strong front leg, she
turned north and once more led the race for
freedom.</p>

<p class='c003'>All afternoon they ran as fast as their
strength would allow. The smell of man hung
in the air before Queen’s nose, poisoning her
blood with hate of him. She had little time
to question, yet her whole soul, confused by
fear and the urgent need to make distance,
sought the why of this two-legged creature,
always breaking in upon their peace and always
hurting them.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last they began to feel that no one was
pursuing them and stopped to investigate.
There was not the faintest glimpse of anything
on hill or horizon and in the air there
was no trace of man. In the evening they
fed about a slough and at night they slept on
the north side of it with their heads turned
toward the south.</p>

<p class='c003'>Early next morning White-black was seized
again by an intense longing for his mother
and braving the terrors of captivity, he started
again in search of her. They were trotting
and walking along leisurely, searching the
spaces constantly when they came upon a hill
from where they spied a number of horses galloping
toward them. They got frightened
and turned back north, but soon stopped again
to ascertain who it was that was coming, and
so these horses gained upon them.</p>

<p class='c003'>They proved to be three of the colts and a
big mare who had somehow broken free from
the cunning little men. They were so excited
that they would not stop to sniff noses. While
they passed through the group they trotted,
but as soon as they were on the other side they
broke away in a gallop. Queen and White-black
and all the rest caught the contagion of
their fear, abandoned their search for those
who were lost to them and ran with the feeling
that danger of captivity had become imminent
once more. And for almost a week
they continued their desultory flight.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the fear of the little men creatures
had lost some of its intensity, White-black and
Queen made several attempts to find the white
mare. Her form seemed to flash across the
prairies like patches of sunlight, seen only at
the vanishing moment. Often they called loud
and long trying in vain to pierce the unknown
and waiting hopelessly for a reply.</p>

<p class='c003'>But this, too, was the inevitable, and railing
and fretting was no solution. In time the
hunger for his mother shrank back into the
depths of White-black’s limited soul and the
full ardour of his love fell to the lot of Queen.
And Queen felt in the touch and the presence
of White-black a compensation for the aches
in her soul, which, like wounds, had healed,
but had left their scars for life.</p>

THE summer days dragged along hot
and enervating. Mosquitoes and nose-flies
in countless numbers became
more and more annoying as the sultry
period prevailed. It made grazing
during most of the daytime very disagreeable.
All through these long days they stood dozing
in small bunches, their chins resting upon each
other’s backs, their tails switching mechanically.
When a momentary gust of wind came
along, they would run down to the sloughs for
water. There they would drink till the stinging
of the pests, who were always in greater
numbers above the tall, wet, slough grass,
would make the place unendurable, then they
would gallop away to the hill tops for relief.</p>

<p class='c003'>Beautifully tolerant of all things, always
moved by the spirit of “live and let live,”
Queen could not understand men and insects.
She could easily see why one horse might kick
at another when the other came along and
greedily seized upon his find of grass; but the
desire to attack without reason or excuse, as it
seemed to be in the character of men and insects,
was unfathomable and wholly foreign to
her nature. Whenever men appeared there
was fear and confusion and anguish. So, too,
as soon as insects arrived, there was pain and
discomfort.</p>

<p class='c003'>Had she been a meat eater, she would have
perceived some connection between the joy of
eating and the tragedy of being eaten; but
Queen belonged to the sweetest-tempered race
on earth, whose sustenance required neither
pain nor blood, and so she could not understand,
and being unable to understand, she
feared.</p>

<p class='c003'>There followed a period of windstorms
which carried the pests away. For a long
time the herd enjoyed once more the freedom
of the wilds; but another hot spell came and
one day as they were eagerly seeking the higher
places, they ran into a cloud of a new kind
of insect, which was worse than anything they
had ever experienced. This new pest settled
upon them in such numbers that they changed
the appearance of their heads and when in
fear they tried to shake them off, the insects
crept into their ears and noses, stinging viciously.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was now the last part of the summer, the
time of the year when young ants, having acquired
their wings, began swarming; and this
was one of the summers when these ants were
more annoying than they usually are. Queen
did not remember ever having come upon this
pest before, and felt that it was peculiar to
the particular neighbourhood in which they
happened to be at the time. Accordingly,
when first attacked by an unusually large
swarm, she turned to the south, and the herd
loped at her heels. By running, they rid themselves
of the young ants and so continued running,
till the cool of the evening cleared the
air of all insects.</p>

<p class='c003'>Next day, however, they ran into another
swarm and again took to flight. Thus they
were driven back again into the vicinity of
the bowl-like valley. There because things
seemed familiar they remained.</p>

<p class='c003'>A season of constant raining followed. The
cold, the excessive wetness, and the strong
winds drove all pests from the plains. The
rainy season passed and frosts came night after
night, spreading layers of white dew on the
grass and freezing the surface of the spring
lake. The exhilarating days of autumn were
at hand, cool, clear, and sunny. The peaceful
nights scintillated with the colours of the
aurora borealis and the unhindered brightness
of the stars. Life became again a protracted
festival.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were startled one afternoon by the
sudden appearance of four strange horses who
came plodding along in single file from the
south. Queen discovered them first as they
were coming down the slope of a hill. Like
the rest of the herd she stopped grazing and
stared at them curiously. Because she saw no
men on them or near them and because they
came so wearily, so unenergetically, she was
not afraid of them, though she regarded them
with suspicion.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they came within a few hundred feet,
the herd moved off to the side, from where
they studied them curiously to learn their intentions.
But the strangers did not even look
toward them. Doggedly bobbing their weary
heads, they made straight for the lake. The
leader was a big, red horse with an ugly pugnacious
face, the nose bone of which curved,
very peculiarly, outward. His hip bones protruded
out of deep hollows in his back and
his sides, fallen in, revealed distinctly every
hair covered rib. Behind him lumbered a
white mare so bent upon limping fast enough to
keep up with him that she did not take her eyes
off him. The third was a miserable-looking
bay pony and the last was an old jade, black
as a crow. All were thin and bedraggled and
two of them had sores on their necks and
breasts. The white mare seemed to have suffered
most, for one of her hind legs was swollen
to twice its normal size, and she limped
very painfully.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the queer-looking procession caught
sight of the lake, they broke the line and ran
down to the water, where they drank as if they
had been without water for many days. While
they were drinking the herd surrounded them,
intending peacefully to sniff noses with them
and to find out who and what manner of
horses they were; but the ugly leader met
the first approach with a kick and an angry
whinny. They soon discovered that though
the other three horses were not as mean, they,
too, were ill-tempered and disagreeable. The
first attempt at understanding resulted in a
noisy quarrel and a stampede. When they settled
down to grazing, the herd was off by itself
and the four strangers were in a corner
of the valley not any too near each other.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen did not like these strangers at all.
She felt that they were responsible for the unpleasant
feeling that now seemed to hang in
the very atmosphere. She did not know then
that slavery and cruelty such as these poor
creatures had endured would sour the best-tempered
horse. What that slavery really
meant she had yet to learn.</p>

<p class='c003'>In spite of her feelings toward the four newcomers,
there was something about the white
mare that made Queen interested in her. She
kept raising her head and looking toward her
and one time as she did so, she saw White-black
approaching her. When Queen saw
them sniffing noses and touching each other
eagerly, she trotted over to them. This time
instead of limping away at her approach, the
white mare waited for her. She seemed glad
to touch noses with Queen; but Queen felt
uncomfortable. The old kindly spirit that
had made the white mare so lovable had given
way to a disagreeable impatience and suspicion;
and her presence set two emotions
struggling with each other in Queen’s heart.
The subtle odour that made Queen think of
some of those distant, weary, winter nights
when she lay close against her old foster
mother, drew her emotionally to the old mare;
while the odour of man and barn repelled her.
Over these emotions like a black cloud in the
sky, hovered a new-born fear as if she had discerned
in the poor mare’s condition the warning:
“Beware of man for thus he breaks
the spirit and the body.”</p>

<p class='c003'>At dusk Queen led the herd in a race over
the plains. The poor white mare who now
clung to Queen and to White-black tried to
follow; but she did not go very far before in
her eagerness she tripped and fell. Queen
and White-back went back to her and grazed
about her. They began to feel that there was
something terrible going to happen to her and
they watched her curiously.</p>

<p class='c003'>That night all three of them lay near each
other. White-black and Queen were fast
asleep in the latter part of the cold night, when
they were awakened by a cry from the white
mare. Queen jumped up in time to get out of
the black old jade’s way. The night was cold
and he was very thin-blooded. Unable to keep
warm he had gone in search of a warmer place
and in his clumsy way had stepped upon
the white mare’s swollen leg. White-black
nipped him on the back and with a cry of
protest he lumbered away into the darkness.
When Queen went back to sleep she was very
much disturbed by the white mare’s groaning.
Several times she woke up and whinnied to
her, but the groaning continued at intervals
all through the night.</p>

<p class='c003'>Next day Queen noticed that blood was
running from her swollen leg, and by nightfall
the white mare was nowhere to be seen.
Queen looked for her for a while and she saw
that White-black too was anxious about her,
but they did not find her that day nor the
next, though they searched for her constantly
as they went about their grazing.</p>

<p class='c003'>The dull days of early winter came back,
grey and silent and ominous. Geese flew over
them daily on their way to the south and their
honking filled Queen with an ineffable sadness.
Suddenly one day as she was grazing
by herself she came upon the body of the
white mare. She touched the cold, hard nose
with her own and sprang away frightened.
She did not try to sniff again. Now she knew
that this was death and hurried away.</p>

<p class='c003'>White-black was grazing almost a quarter of
a mile away. Queen trotted over to him and
whinnied repeatedly. He answered her, but
he did not know what ailed her. She walked
away a short distance and called him. First
he replied while grazing, then at the second
call, he raised his head and walked toward
her. But he was no sooner pulling away at
some grass there, when he discovered that she
was some distance away again and calling as
hard as ever. For some reason known only to
her she was leading him away to the north
again and though he went reluctantly at first,
with the rest of the herd following him, they
were soon well on their way. A few miles
from the lake, they stopped, however, for fear
that they might not come upon water. There
were in this group no more than a dozen of
them, all colts that had been brought up together,
and they were glad to be by themselves,
though as they moved on, the rest of
the horses, miles behind, moved after them.
When a snowstorm came and filled all the
hollows, they began once more moving northward
in earnest. Forces they could not understand
impelled them. Thus they abandoned
forever the scenes of their youth.</p>

<p class='c003'>The winter passed like a night of pleasure.
Protected on the north by a strip of woodland
many miles long, Queen and her companions
slept the long nights away. The snow,
deep in many places, was not very deep near
the wall of poplars and feeding came comparatively
easily. On sunny days they spent as
much time chasing each other through the
deepest drifts as they did in pawing for
grass. The dry snows made warm blankets
and the howling winds, shrieking in the
poplars, provided music for their enjoyment
of life, often sad, but for all its sadness,
sweet.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were big and strong now. Blood
flowed rich and freely through their veins and
the hair on their bodies, which was as long as
the hair on the bears that at very rare intervals
showed themselves and disappeared, kept
them warm. The elements, no matter how
savagely they raged, could not become disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c003'>A few weeks of springtime with open plains
to lope over and new grass, and they grew daily
stronger and fleeter. Sorrows of the dead past
were forgotten and the joys of the present
were so all absorbing that even man seemed
to have become extinct, as far as they were
concerned.</p>

<p class='c003'>To the joy of unlimited space, of surging
healthy blood, of plenty to eat and drink, of
peaceful and constant companionship was
added the aesthetic pleasures of love. Having
first discovered in themselves preferences for
members of the opposite sex, they began to
see traits and characteristics in their choice
which thrilled them.</p>

<p class='c003'>There were, of course, petty quarrels now
and then, since love will not come unaccompanied
by strife, and nature is not always
provident, or when she is provident, so often
disorderly. There were some disappointments
and the weak, helpless here as the weak are
helpless everywhere, often had to give way to
the strong; but the tragedy that follows love
among ferocious and greedy animals never
marred their happier relations; and even the
weaker ones found love requited. Life on the
rim of love was so rich, Nature beyond love
was so lavish, hurts healed before the wounds
reached the flesh.</p>

<p class='c003'>But to Queen and White-black life was a
game in which even tiredness had its delight.
Strong and healthy and beautiful, admired by
the rest and followed in their every whim,
they played through the uninterrupted carnival
of laughing spring and smiling, drowsy
summer. When winter came again, they
met it without fear, willing to wade through
deep snows, accepting the violent lashes of
wind and blizzard, warming their hearts in
the expectant joy of another spring and another
summer, looking upon life, in their innocence,
as an endlessly interesting cycle in
which winter was the greatest discomfort and
spring its eternal retribution.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THEN came an early spring. Geese returned
from the south. The sadness
in their honking had given way to the
exaltation of rebirth. The snows
melted almost in a day. Hundreds of
wild ducks populated the many sloughs in the
hollows, and filled the delightful evenings
with the soft calling of their love-making. In
the still nights or as she lay through the rest
periods which she now so strangely needed,
Queen kept her ears pricked high to catch
the last faint sound of every love call and the
air now almost always vibrated with some one
form or another of these calls.</p>

<p class='c003'>White-black, still a playful colt, thrilled
her with his presence or the touch of his lovely
nose; but something sweet and remote was
mysteriously laying hold upon the love in her
heart. She liked to half close her eyes and
doze, floating as she dozed, on the waves of
this new emotion. It seemed a joyous feeling
all her own and unlike any joy she had ever
experienced before. It was a joy she felt
within, a joy that expressed itself best in
dreaming rather than in the activity that her
other joys had always stimulated.</p>

<p class='c003'>She liked to wander away by herself.
White-black would follow her about a good
deal and sought to arouse her old play spirit;
but when he realised that he could not influence
her any more as he used to, he learned to
let her alone. She seemed to have lost her
agility and preferred to be on the outskirts of
the circle of the herd where she could move
about with less excitement. She liked to wander
around the small ponds and listen to the
croaking of frogs, always lingering till the
night shadows lay thick over all things and she
heard the ineffable half murmur, half song of
wild ducks, as they paddled along in the stillness
of the night.</p>

<p class='c003'>Often by day she would stop her shuffling
gait and with her nose down among the blades
of grass, she would watch the little sandpiper,
wondering what he meant with his heart-rending
<i>pee-weet</i> and his eternal seeking.
Sometimes she would stand for a long time
and watch the brown curlew and listen to his
persistent, lugubrious complaint. All these
sounds, these melodious cries of strange little
souls, somehow responded harmoniously to
voices and emotions in her own soul, and she
looked upon them as fellow beings of the wilds
she loved, knowing each by the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>So too the woods interested her, though she
had never penetrated them very far, because
the woods were confining and she loved the
open where one could see and run in all directions.
Yet she loved the trees because these
new emotions which had mysteriously come
to her made her more observant than she had
been. She realised more fully than ever before
that woods and plains and skies had moods
in each of which they were different, and
these revelations broadening her outlook upon
her surroundings made her, in a way, more
capable of joy.</p>

<p class='c003'>To White-black she was a puzzle. Yielding
to her desire to be alone and interesting himself
in other friends, he nevertheless kept an
eye on her. There came a period in which he
missed her entirely. Day after day, he went
looking for her and then one day he found her
in the woods, on an open grassy spot, cut off
from the plains by a small pond and a thin
wall of poplars. She was licking a small
black colt that was trying very hard to stand
on its long, shaky legs.</p>

<p class='c003'>White-black was so glad to see her he began
to neigh excitedly and caper about the
water’s edge. Then, wading across the pond,
he ran toward her; but she sprang between
him and her baby with an angry whinny, ears
down, eyes glowing and her lips curling
threateningly. He stopped a few paces from
her and whinnied placatingly; but she threatened
him again and he was afraid to approach.
He gazed at her from where he was for a few
minutes, then like a man who, failing to understand,
shrugs his shoulders, he lowered his
head and began to graze, looking up occasionally
to see if she had changed her attitude
in any way. At last, discouraged, he walked
to the pond, took a long drink, waded across
and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c003'>For several days Queen kept to herself in
her own little pasture in the woods. She
knew just where the herd was and what they
were doing at all times for she watched them
almost as anxiously as she watched over her
little son. Her baby grew stronger every day,
spending most of his time romping about the
limited space, learning to use his awkward
legs; and as he grew stronger, the desire to
return to the herd began to make Queen restless.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last she led the little fellow carefully
around the pond, but just as she reached the
open space she saw the herd gathering as if
danger threatened. She stopped short, raised
her beautiful head and with one long nervous
sniff took in the whole situation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Man again!</p>

<p class='c003'>She could not see the horseman, but she
heard the faint, far away patter of hoofs and
the scent of man trickled through the air.
She turned about and looked at her little one
who was innocently indifferent to what worried
her and extremely interested in the open
space of which, being behind her, he had
caught but a glimpse. She knew that if she
attempted to join the herd and fly with them,
he could not follow her. She could hear, as
she tried to decide what to do, the sudden
clamour of hoof-beats as the herd broke into a
race for safety. She did not even turn to see
them go. With utmost haste she glided under
cover.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was not content with what safety the
little pasture offered. As if she had been a
creature of the woods, she picked her way
through thorny shrubs and under heavy
branches, till she came to a secluded spot that
satisfied her and there she lay down to regain
her composure.</p>

<p class='c003'>For almost a week she lived like a deer,
hiding in the woods and coming out by night
to graze and to seek the herd which she hoped
would return. Then as the days went by and
she had come upon no trace of man in the air
of the open prairies, she ceased going back
into the woods, and divided her time between
her baby, feeding, and looking wistfully and
hopefully over hill and hollow for her lost
companions, calling, calling, calling till the
solitudes echoed with the anguish in her heart.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her interest in the small living things that
went about the daily business of their little
lives revived and the anxious searching of the
plains often gave way to an absorbed study of
her little neighbours. She came upon a mother
duck, one day, who was waddling down the
old buffalo trail with a brood of tiny little
ducklings, only a few yards away from her.
Queen slackened her pace when she saw that
the mother duck was getting excited, and
watched them. The old duck walked on as
rapidly as she could, turning her head from
side to side as she scrutinised Queen first with
one eye and then with the other, and though
she did not seem to consider her a very grave
danger she called her little ones and swerved
off the path. The old duck was apparently
leading them to the slough, but she hadn’t
gone very far when a lean and hungry-looking
coyote shot out from a cluster of rosebushes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Instantly there was a frantic whir of wings
and while the mother duck flew almost upon
the coyote, the little ones scattered, dropping
down under bushes or flowers or disappearing
in gopher holes. Queen was too much worried
about her own baby to notice at the time
what happened to the duck. She sprang protectingly
toward her foal and then when she
looked up she saw the coyote running eagerly
after the duck, who acted as if one of her
wings were broken. Flopping with one wing
she cried with fright and half flew, half ran
on ahead of him. The foolish coyote
thought she was wounded and licked his chops
as he ran, anticipating a good meal.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old duck appeared to be losing; but
always just as the coyote was about to seize
her she flew off with a cry. Thus she led him
far away and out of sight. But before Queen
had started off again for the slough, she saw
the anxious mother duck come flying from the
opposite direction. Queen turned from her to
where the coyote had disappeared wondering
whether he was coming back. The joyous
peeping of the little brood who appeared in
all directions at the first call of their mother,
reassured her and she followed them down to
the pond.</p>

<p class='c003'>The duck and the little ones set sail as soon
as they touched the water, and paddled away
triumphantly to the centre of the slough where
among the rushes no foolish coyote could
threaten them. The lesson of duck wisdom
impressed itself deeply on Queen’s mind in a
series of pictures, and she sensed acutely the
trick the duck had played upon the coyote.
She hated the coyote because she feared him.
The very sight of him made her uncomfortable
and she did not let the little one out of
her sight for an instant. Even when she drank,
the image of the beast would come into her
mind and between sips she would raise her
head and stare all around her to make sure
that he hadn’t come back; for from that time
on, she seemed to expect him to show up at
any moment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Long as the days were at this time of the
year, they succeeded each other rapidly and
each day added to the weight of loneliness on
Queen’s heart. Ducks came in great numbers,
returning from their sojourns into the
land of motherhood with flourishing broods.
Gophers appeared everywhere. The saucy
little fellows would sit up on their haunches
a yard away from Queen’s head and defy her
with their queer little barks, which betrayed
much more fear than defiance. The colt
would look at them with his large, round eyes,
sometimes making an attempt to approach
them but as soon as he came too near they
fled. Coyotes began to show themselves more
and more often, and every time Queen came
upon one, even the clear memory of the duck
playing her trick could not prevent her heart
from throbbing with fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>A variety of flowers appeared, one kind
giving way to another, and the sloughs on the
open began to shrink daily. The woods retained
their ponds, cool and clear, and in the
darker corners, among the tall poplars, there
were still shrunken drifts of snow.</p>

<p class='c003'>In spite of the abundance of food and
water, in spite of her growing interest in her
baby who played about her in perfect contentment,
and played more and more delightfully,
Queen’s longing for her companions
reached overwhelming proportions and at last
she started away from those solitudes in search
of the herd.</p>

<p class='c003'>For several days she travelled toward the
east along the wall of the woods. She came
to where the woods ended and a vast treeless
plain stretched away beyond vision. From the
pointed end of the woods, an old, partially
overgrown buffalo trail cut diagonally across
the prairie, running comparatively straight
southeast. There she remained for a few days
as if unable to decide which way to go. Then,
one day, when she had followed the buffalo
trail for several miles she came upon signs of
the herd. This puzzled her, for experience
had taught her not to go south; yet here was
unmistakable evidence that they had gone
south; and <i>they</i> were her goal. Despite her
disinclination to go in that direction, she went
on eagerly, moving each day as far as her colt
would go without protest, and resting when he
refused to go any farther.</p>

<p class='c003'>One evening, long after the woods had
faded out of sight, when her baby balked at
the daily increase in the distance she urged
him to make and deliberately lay down on the
path, she saw what seemed to be two horses,
grazing. Queen broke the stillness with an
impassioned whinnying that puzzled the little
fellow. The fact that she was standing with
her back to him and whinnying so frantically
interested him. That she might be calling to
any one but himself was entirely beyond his
experience. Feeling that she was looking for
him, he got up and sidled up to her, touching
her neck with his little nose. Queen bent
down and covered him with caresses; but to
his dismay, she soon returned to her calling,
keeping her head high and looking away into
the shadows.</p>

<p class='c003'>The darkness obliterated the two horses
and Queen, unable to stand still, started away
again, the little fellow complaining plaintively
as he lumbered after her. When, however,
he lay down once more, she yielded and
there they spent the night.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her night’s rest was a troubled one. What
with other emotions tormenting her, there was
a strong scent of man in the air that kept her
awake and watchful. When dawn came at
last, she saw the two horses, still grazing but
much nearer to her. Beyond them she saw
two black mounds, like malignant growths on
the body of the plains. In these mounds, she
knew, lived man.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was afraid to go any closer to the
mounds so she called loudly to the two horses
who finally responded by starting in her direction.
When she saw them coming, she hastened
to meet them, despite her fear. She
whinnied loudly as she went and when the
foremost of the two horses replied to her, his
voice sounded familiar. Who it was she did
not know but she started toward him on a gallop
and as soon as she touched his nose, she
remembered the old sorrel work-horse of the
spring lake in the bowl-like valley of her
childhood.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where he had been, how he had got up
there, what he was doing, these were facts
Queen could not find out, nor did she experience
any desire to find out. Life to her was
somewhat of an abysmal night with beautiful,
star-like gleams of understanding. The past
to her was an ally of death not to be thought
about and the future became important only
when it turned into the present. The sole
value of the impressions that she carried in
her memory lay in the help they offered for
the understanding of the impressions that the
present was making and Queen never wept
over them.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was the old sorrel before her! The
memory of what he had been to her, inundated
by floods of time and other experiences, had
gone out like the stars at dawn. But now, certain
odours and sounds and qualities too delicate
for words, like the evening that follows
every dawn, brought the stars back to her sky
and she strove to express the almost inexpressible
satisfaction she experienced.</p>

<p class='c003'>The other horse was a stranger and so
Queen was wary of him. She sniffed noses
with him suspiciously and kept away, refusing
to allow him to go near her colt whereas the
old sorrel sniffed all over him without her
protest.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the pleasure she derived from the momentary
satisfaction of the longing for companionship,
inadequate as it was, had its price.
Her excitement was so great that she did not
notice the coming of another horse with a man
on his back, till he was already dangerously
close. With an anxious call to her little one
she dashed away in the direction from which
she had come. The two horses went with her.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not long however before she saw the
man through the corner of her eye, urging his
straining horse, apparently to get ahead of
her. Queen was not running as fast as she
could, for she knew that her baby could not
keep up with her. But the sight of the man
at the side of her bewildered her. She leaped
out of his way, leaving him a hundred feet
behind only to realise at once that her colt
was not with her. She swung off to the side
and turned to see the man driving the old sorrel,
his companion, and her own colt off towards
the black mounds.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her eyes fairly bulging out of her head, her
lips frothing, Queen leaped back after him,
calling frantically to him as she ran. As soon
as the little thing heard her, he turned to run
back, but instantly the man threw a rope and
caught him round the neck, hurling him to the
ground. The two horses ran on toward the
mounds, but the man stopped, dismounted and
battled with her frightened, crying baby.</p>

<p class='c003'>The desire to hurt was foreign to Queen’s
nature, but when she saw her foal on the
ground struggling with the man who was apparently
getting the better of it, she ran toward
the monster with murder in her heart.
The man saw her coming and with the other
end of his long rope he struck her head a terrible
blow. She jumped back in terror. Before
she had aroused enough courage to make another
attack, the man had completely tied the
little thing so that it could not move a limb
and, mounting his horse again, he rode away.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen rushed to her little son with a sense
of relief but that feeling soon gave way to one
of painful solicitude. She had her baby and
the man had left, but the baby was helplessly
tied. It was changed with a change like
death. The monstrous two-legged creature
had cast a spell upon it. She ran around it
frantically, called to it encouragingly, licked
it tenderly, then ran off a few paces, urging
it to exert itself and follow her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then to her horror, she saw the man coming
back. This time he had the sorrel and his
companion with him. She grew desperate.
She bit at the rope with nervous haste, trying
to drag her colt away with her, but her efforts
resulted only in hurting it and at the first cry
of pain, she stopped. Until the man was so
near that he struck her with the long binder
whip which he had brought with him, she
would not leave her baby and then she only
kept out of reach of the whip. Finally, in
desperation, unable to decide upon anything
that she might try to do, she stood and
watched; while the man was busy, preparing
the ropes on the stone boat which the two
horses had been dragging after them.</p>

<p class='c003'>One thing at once hurt and puzzled her,
and that was the nonresistance of the old sorrel.
There he stood covered with the bewildering
straps with their glittering buckles,
making no attempt to run from the man nor
to help her. He did not even call to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She tried to make out how the man succeeded
in holding the two horses though he
was not even looking at them. Her deliberations,
however, were suddenly interrupted by
the man’s leaving the stone boat and going to
her little one. When she saw him drag the
colt to the stone boat, she went mad again and
rushed at him with bared teeth; but as soon as
he straightened himself and turned to her, she
fled.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her hatred included the old sorrel when
she saw him start away dragging her baby off.
She sprang at him from the side and nipped
him savagely. The old fellow got frightened
and backed up almost stepping upon the helpless
little colt on the stone boat. The man got
angry. He jumped from the stone boat and
with his long whip struck her with all his
strength squarely upon her tender nose. The
pain took her breath away. She reared on
her hind legs in a fit of agony, then dashed out
of reach, and the man drove off with her colt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Bewildered by her anguish, she ran after
him, rending the air with her cries, zigzagging
from one side to the other. When the
man reached one of the black mounds, his sod
barn, Queen remained at a distance, running
around the place in a wide circle and running
steadily as if she found relief in activity.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man disappeared in the black mound,
but when Queen ventured nearer, for fear
that she would again attack the old sorrel, the
man poked his head out of a hole in the wall
and yelled at her; and she turned and ran.
When she started for the barn again, the man
came out altogether. She was forty rods away
when she turned and as she did so she heard
the strong, healthy call from her colt, muffled
by the confinement of the barn; but apparently
free as if he were untied. She replied
with all her strength and ran toward the barn,
stopping a hundred feet away and watching
the man, as he fastened the barn-door
securely.</p>

<p class='c003'>She saw him unhook the horses from the
stone boat and then drive them over to a queer-looking
instrument that lay near the house.
Then she saw them start away with the plow
dragging behind the horses. They were coming
toward her so she loped away to the
right. When she stopped, she saw that they
were not following her but were going off
toward the south. Considerably relieved she
watched them go till they were lost from view
behind a hill.</p>

<p class='c003'>She trotted up to the first of the two
mounds, the man’s small, sod house and cautiously
sniffed about for a few minutes to
make sure that there was no other man about.
The odours there were unendurable, but everything
was motionless, and at a call from her
little one, she ran to the barn. For a while
she ran round and round it as she called, then
suddenly she spied his little head through a
hole in the wall. She attempted to thrust her
head in. She just managed to touch him with
her hot lips, but the fear of the evil-smelling
barn forced her to withdraw her head, in spite
of her desire to keep touching him. She had
the feeling of being trapped herself and immediately
loped away again. A thorough
examination of the house and the plains, however,
assured her that she was still free and
that the man was not returning.</p>

<p class='c003'>Again and again she thrust her head into
the hole, and despite the nauseating odours she
prolonged her caresses every succeeding time
that she put her head through the window.
Yet she realised that that was not giving her
back her baby. At the same time the touch
of his beloved head intensified the fire in her
heart and she began desperately to seek some
way of getting him out.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a pile of manure back of the
barn which sloped upward till it almost
reached the flat, straw roof. She ran around
the barn in an attempt to find some opening
and every time she came to the heap of manure
she was forced to enlarge the circle she
was making. With a look in every direction,
to make sure the man was not returning, she
suddenly started up the pile of manure and
carefully stepped upon the roof of the barn.</p>

<p class='c003'>She had only taken a step forward, though,
when she felt the roof giving way under her
feet. This frightened her and she attempted
to turn back much too hastily. Before she
could get back to the pile of dirt, half the roof
together with a part of the wall caved in, dropping
her down into the barn on top of the
débris. She was very badly frightened. Without
stopping even to look for her colt, she
leaped over the remaining portion of the wall
taking half of it with her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She did not turn to see what she had accomplished
but fled in terror over the fields.
When her courage returned, she looked back
and happily discovered that still the man had
not returned, nor was there any other sign of
danger. On the other hand her little colt was
now standing near the broken wall, his head
and shoulder sticking up above it, calling
frantically. She then hurried back with all
her speed, caressing him as if she hadn’t seen
him for weeks, and urging him, in her dumb
way, to come out.</p>

<p class='c003'>He tried very hard to get over the barrier,
but could not make it. To show him how to
do it, she jumped in again and as she jumped
she knocked another layer of sod into the
barn. Then as she was about to leap out a second
time she heard a familiar whinny behind
her. Turning nervously, she made out in the
gloom of the other end of the barn, two horses,
one of them her mate. Poor White-black was
standing listlessly in a cage-like stall, securely
tied to the manger. His voice was weaker
than it had ever been, and his calling seemed
strangely half-hearted. A great desire to
touch his nose came over her, though the fear
of the barn, the frightfully nauseating odours
and the slippery, dirty floor, all urged her to
fly before some mysterious force should seize
her and hold her there. All she was able to do
was to call to him from where she stood trembling
near the opening in the wall, ready to
jump at the first sign of danger. The sound of
her own voice in the confines of the gloomy
barn terrified her. With a single bound she
leaped over the broken wall, taking so much
more of it with her, lowering it so decidedly
that the little fellow was able to climb over it.</p>

<p class='c003'>With a last heartfelt call to White-Black,
appealing to him to follow her as he used to
follow her in the days that had gone, Queen
raced once more toward the haven of the
north, ran against all feeble protest of her
little son, ran till the loathsome mounds vanished
from the undulating plains.</p>

<p class='c003'>In a hollow where a spring slough had
turned much of the earth into mud and then
had partially dried up, Queen drank, fed her
baby; and, because he would go no further,
she grazed while he rested. She felt very
unsafe and gazed incessantly and fearfully
toward the hilltop behind her. Two images
she expected to see coming over the brow
every time she looked up. She expected and
feared to see the man coming after her and
she expected and hoped to see White-black.
Neither came, but both haunted her stormy
mind and allowed it no peace.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fear urged her to be off and away but every
time she started, her little fellow refused to go
with her. He would raise his head painfully
from the grass and call to her but he would
not get up. He had not taken all the milk
there was for him and he acted very peculiarly,
but Queen’s fear was implacable. She pretended
to leave him and ran all the way up the
other slope of the hollow. He called to her
in a frenzy of fear, but though her heart beat
fast for him, she did not reply and when she
began to disappear over the summit of the hill
he got up in haste and ran with all his strength
till he found her but a few feet from the summit.
She whinnied to him lovingly but continued
her trot and he wearily followed her.</p>

<p class='c003'>A peculiar note in his cry, some distance
farther on, made her turn round to look at
him. She saw him touch his shoulder with
his little nose and as he touched it she saw a
swarm of insects fly off from the spot. She
walked back to him and discovered a deep
gash that ran across his breast and up his other
shoulder. The hideous cut was covered by
lumps of coagulated blood and the insects settled
back on it as soon as he withdrew his
nose.</p>

<p class='c003'>She proceeded at once to lick the wound till
she found it was bleeding again and stopped,
bewildered by the dripping blood. But the
bigger problem presented itself anew. She
looked up suddenly and spied, on the horizon
in the direction from which she had come, a
black moving object. She was certain that it
was the man coming after her and springing
forward a few paces stopped suddenly when
she found that her colt was not following her.
She stamped her foot frantically, calling to
him with more terror than urge.</p>

<p class='c003'>He started bravely after her, but the more
he ran, the more his wound opened, and the
coagulation that had taken place and was trying
to take place failed to save him. Queen,
who loved him with magnificent passion, did
not know that her running was killing him.
What could she have done if she had known?
The man was fast gaining in the chase. Man
always gained, save where death entered the
race and death was slowly defeating this man.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last, the little fellow dropped, exhausted.
When she hurried back to caress and to urge
him on, she knew that he could go no further.
The man had disappeared behind a hill.
Queen ran back with a mad, desperate impulse
to bar his way to her little son. The image
of a mother duck flying into the face of a
coyote, flashed through her brain. She ran
down one hillside and up another, her throbbing
sides wet with perspiration, and in the
valley below that, she saw him.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was somewhat to the right of her. Seeing
her he turned to the left. She, too, turned
left and she ran trying to keep a hill between
them. As soon as she heard him coming over
the hill that was between them she raced over
the next hill. In that way she led him several
miles north, then running for the first time as
fast as she could go, she fled west.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the top of one of the hills, she stopped
finally and looked back. She saw the man
turn homeward and before he should see her,
she dropped down into a valley and there she
started back to her colt, running now as fast
as ever, though her sides were white with
foam. When she got to a second hilltop and
found that the man had disappeared and that
there was no trace of him in the air, she loped
along a bit more easily.</p>

<p class='c003'>The belated summer evening was coming at
last. The sun, very red and big, lowered on
one side of her and high in the heavens the
moon grew brighter. She came to a slough
and drank. She gulped the water a moment,
then raising her noble head, pricked her ears
and listened, the water dripping from her
mouth. It seemed to her that she had heard
a coyote somewhere in the distance. She grew
troubled and fearful again, running in her
confusion beyond the hill where she should
have turned.</p>

<p class='c003'>Instead of going right back she turned
south and when she ran into the trail of blood
that his open wound had left on the grass, she
was quite some distance away from him. But
she was on his trail and with her nose low to
the ground she trotted along hopefully till she
was suddenly startled by the hideous cry of
a coyote. She stopped, completely terrified,
and listened. A cry of a second coyote, nearer,
responded to the first from the other side of
the hill before her.</p>

<p class='c003'>With a few bounds she was at the top of the
hill. Not a dozen feet down the slope sat a
coyote over the lifeless body of her colt. He
had eaten a great deal and was heavy with
meat. He was so completely surprised that
he could not move for a moment. It was too
late to move. She was so close to him that he
was afraid to turn. He bared his teeth in a
feeble effort at defiance and snarled, but
Queen was too furious to think of herself.
With all the strength of madness she hurled
herself upon him and over him, leaping away
in terror and carrying with her the sensation
of hoof crushing bone. When she was quite
certain that there was nothing pursuing her,
she thought he had run away and so nervously
trotted back to her baby.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came back cautiously a step at a time,
her eyes gleaming like burning coals, her skin
quivering with fear. She saw the black
shadowy mass that was her colt and then she
made out a second black mass beside it. A
few steps nearer and she began to feel that
she had rendered the coyote motionless, but
when she got quite close she saw the beast’s
hind legs kick backward in the throes of death.
Queen did not know that he was dying, but she
did know by the motionlessness of his head
that she had him at a disadvantage and she
approached with less fear and beat at him
with her hoof just as she had many a time
beaten a hole in the ice over a pond.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally she revolted against a task so foreign
to her nature and turned as if with sudden
realisation of something overwhelmingly
terrible, to the almost unrecognisable body of
her foal. But she only sniffed once and sprang
away with a snort and cry. Round and round
the hilltop she ran expressing the agony in
her soul with loud and plaintive, fearful calls
to which there was no answer in all the infinity
of space.</p>

<p class='c003'>The odours were maddening. The place became
unbearable and in her soul the desire for
the companionship of the herd flared up like a
great light in the torturous darkness. It was
as if she saw them somewhere in the gloomy
spaces and running would bring her to them.
So she loped and trotted northward, all night.
At dawn, too weary to continue on her feet,
she lay down to rest and as she rested she
cropped the grass about her. A few hours
of rest and she was ready to continue her
anxious journey.</p>

<p class='c003'>When toward noon she came to where
the familiar woods appeared on the horizon
Queen accelerated her pace. It was there in
that woods that the beloved little thing had
come to her, and she loped as if she expected
to find it there again. Forgotten were all the
aches in her muscles. What pain of body can
outweigh the pain of mother mind at the loss
of her baby? Deny the animal all the finer
emotions you like! Mother love is too obvious
a quality of the lowest animal life to be denied.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the moment Queen saw the familiar
trees, the moment she entered the shadowy,
fragrant atmosphere of the woods where the
little thing had been born, the image of it,
wandering about elusively in the solitude,
came plaintively calling into her soul and she
turned back upon the trail of sorrow. Back
over the plains she ran, as if her speed could
save it, ran as if some evil man creature were
carrying it away, running off with it, ahead
of her, just out of sight.</p>

<p class='c003'>An overwhelming sense of bodily weariness
came over her at sundown and she lay down
to sleep; and all through her heavy slumber,
she pursued her elusive baby and struggled
with monstrous man and hungry coyote.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
EVERY dawn on the plains is the miracle
of creation, and the best philosophy
for man or animal lies in this
daily beginning. “Endure Sorrow’s
night,” says the dawn, “then rise with
me and plan for the day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Before her on the emerging plain lay a
suspicious-looking stone. Without moving
her head, Queen regarded it a long time. It
was altogether too woolly for a stone. Her
scrutiny brought strange sensations and her
heart began to beat rapidly. A gust of soft
morning breeze swept down from the hill and
the stone moved. Queen sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>With its hungry face turned toward her, the
coyote glided away. Sorrow’s night was over
and Queen loped after him with a new notion
of life. The faster and the more fearfully
he ran, the more faith Queen acquired in
her own superiority, the more consolation she
derived from the hope and the will to crush
him, as she had crushed the other one.</p>

<p class='c003'>He swung off toward the northwest. She
too turned northwest. He stopped to sit down
on his haunches and to look back at her, to
learn if possible the purpose of this uncanny
mare. But as soon as he sat down she seemed
to increase her effort to reach him. When she
got too near, he bounded away out of reach.
When he tried to turn in a new direction, she
turned and headed him off, forcing him north
against his will.</p>

<p class='c003'>Wherever he went she pursued him doggedly.
Over hills, down into valleys, around
sloughs, she went driven by emotions she had
never experienced before. But while these
emotions drove her, others retarded her and
the coyote began to leave her farther and
farther behind, growing smaller and smaller
in the distance. Finally Queen abandoned
the chase and turned with satisfaction to
grazing.</p>

<p class='c003'>Long after he had disappeared, however,
Queen scrutinised the indistinct spaces in
which he had sunk out of sight. She had been
grazing a long while and had almost forgotten
about the coyote, when she looked up once
more and discovered a tiny object moving on
the sky-line. There was no doubt in Queen’s
mind as to what that object was. She galloped
away at full speed and did not stop till
she was out of breath. For a while she lost
sight of the object, because of a deep and
winding hollow through which she was
obliged to pass, but when she reached a high
place again, she beheld with great joy a group
of horses still so far away that they did not
notice her coming.</p>

<p class='c003'>She called constantly as she ran, though she
did so more to express her own excitement
than with any hope of getting their attention.
When at last they heard her, every head went
up and every pair of ears turned forward.
The big, brown colt, her old rival in the race,
left the group first and started for her. As
soon as she recognised him, Queen knew that
she had found her old companions. Her joy
was insuppressible. She rushed from one to
the other and caressed the little colts till they
fled in terror of her passion.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a brown, fuzzy little fellow, the
foal of a big, good-natured sorrel mare.
Queen caressed it emotionally. The little
fellow endured it without any kind of manifestation
for a little while, then suddenly he decided
to take advantage of the situation.
Queen gave him her milk most willingly, but
his mother watched the performance with
growing dissatisfaction. When he had had
about all he could have she jumped at him to
prevent him from going back for more and
incidentally showed her jealousy by pretending
to bite Queen. Queen sprang out of the
way, manifesting clearly her disinclination to
fight over it.</p>

<p class='c003'>In spite of the big mare’s protests, Queen
fed him again before nightfall. When the
mother objected again, she relinquished temporarily
and led the whole group in a merry
race round the hill top. Her desire to be
active, born of emotions that would not down
within her, was contagious. She could not
rest and every time she started off with a toss
of her head, the herd was at her heels.</p>

<p class='c003'>In spite of all the weary days of journeying
in the tragic period that had just passed out
of her life, so tense was Queen’s joy at meeting
her companions, so full was her life again,
now that she had friends to love life with, and
a colt to drink her milk, that she seemed to
have lost the faculty of feeling weariness, and
frisked about in the shower of moonlight like
a gratified colt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not far off lay the carcass of a dead horse,
from which life, tired of baffling snows all
winter and toiling for man all summer, had
departed. Over this carcass a pack of
coyotes were savagely feasting and their
hymns to the god of coyotedom disturbed
Queen’s revelry. Several times she ran off a
short distance in the direction from which the
insane howling was coming. Every time she
started off the herd started with her. Locating
the coyotes half way down the long slope,
Queen first circled around the hilltop, then
suddenly turned down the slope at breakneck
speed. Like an ocean wave the herd swept
down the incline.</p>

<p class='c003'>The coyotes were taken completely by surprise.
Not until the herd was almost upon
them did they attempt to escape, fleeing then
chaotically in all directions. But the horses
also spread out to avoid the carcass; and with
momentum stronger than their fear, they stampeded
across the paths of the fleeing pack.
Most of the scavengers escaped but one was
struck down. At the foot of the hill Queen
turned back to the dismay of the herd. They
watched her curiously as she trotted, some distance
ahead of them, up the incline.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came to the miserable creature whose
back had been broken. Unable to move his
hind legs, he dragged them along behind as
he crept away with his forelegs. But Queen
did not let him get away. The herd had by
this time timorously come after her. Stepping
back a moment before the flashing teeth and
the gleaming eyes she rushed at him again and
struck him upon the head with a sharp, front
hoof. She struck him again and again as if
moved by the terror of the thing she was doing.
The herd had come up toward her but when
they saw her attacking the coyote they got
frightened and ran away. Queen then abandoned
the lifeless form and ran to join them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Far away on the moonlit sky-line sat the
rest of the coyote pack, their nozzles turning
periodically to the moon and baying madly
against the betrayal of their god. Never in
all their savage experience had they come
upon such a herd of horses and never again
would they expose themselves to its madness.</p>

<p class='c003'>Without vote or discussion, without struggle
or rivalry, Queen assumed her regency.
Her will became the will of the herd. Queen
she became in earnest, in the highest sense of
the word, ruling neither for gain nor power,
ruling solely for love of freedom and her companions.
And her ruling was the salvation
of the herd and the consternation of the homesteaders
whose wretched shacks skirted her
domains.</p>

THE prairie grass began once more to
wither and grow grey. The winds
assumed again their autumnal sadness
and moaned with an aimless complaint.
Again dead thistles began
rolling over the plains, expressing somehow
in their helpless rolling the relentlessness of
change. Frosts rewhitened the morning earth
and geese honked again on their flight to the
south.</p>

<p class='c003'>The herd was grazing on a hillslope. On
the top of the hill stood Queen. The wind
was tugging away at her mane and tail, but
otherwise she was as motionless as the hill she
was standing on. Her eyes were fixed upon
two horses coming from the southeast and
more than a mile away.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once or twice the brown colt, now a full
grown stallion, fat and almost clumsy, raised
his head to look as she was looking; but most
of the others were busy seeking better grasses
and wild plants they liked, until Queen, with
a partially suppressed whinny of excitement
trotted away to meet the newcomers. At
once the peaceful scene broke into activity.</p>

<p class='c003'>But when they had come within a quarter of
a mile of the two horses, they stopped. A white
horse that made Queen think of White-black,
tied to a sorrel horse that made her think of
the old sorrel work-horse, running as fast as
they could under the circumstances, were
coming toward them, by fits and starts. The
white horse, as he came, kept stepping backward
and raising his head every once in a
while, only to leap forward again a few paces.
Always as he leaped forward something
dragged him back by the head. They would
run on together for a short distance and then
the same thing would happen again.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they got very near, in spite of her interest,
Queen’s fear of the scent of man which
clung to them got the better of her and she led
away till the apparition was out of sight.
There the herd waited for its reappearance.
When they did appear the herd fled again.
This they kept up for the greater part of the
day. Toward evening Queen made another
attempt to find out just what was wrong. By
this time she was convinced that there was no
man with them anywhere, and the labourious
manner in which these miserable creatures
followed them mitigated her fear of their
being dangerous.</p>

<p class='c003'>She went round on a curve and stopped
some fifty feet from the two weary animals.
The sorrel, now about a foot behind the white
horse, snorting as if he had great difficulty in
breathing, took the opportunity during the
moment’s rest to brace his body with his front
legs against the pulling of the white one. The
white one, driven by some fear, began pulling
and tugging as soon as he had caught his
breath; but he couldn’t budge the old fellow
an inch. Queen advanced fearfully. The
scent of man, despite the fact that there was
no man about, worried her even as the growing
certainty that these were her old companions
drew her toward them. Finally she ventured
near enough to touch the white nose
that came forward a few inches to meet hers.
White-black it was! Poor, abused White-black,
covered with barn dirt, his sides fallen
in through struggle and lack of sufficient food.</p>

<p class='c003'>A touch of the old sorrel’s nose brought him
to his proper place in her mind and Queen
ran from one to the other, feeling vaguely
that the spell of the dirty barn was still holding
both of them in captivity, and trying to
arrive at some plan of helping them, yet not
having the faintest idea of what to do.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old sorrel was by far the weaker one of
the two. He was evidently just about exhausted.
His poor old sides expanded and
contracted rapidly and his dirty flanks were
literally wet with foamy perspiration.
Though White-black took advantage of their
halt and grazed as far as the entanglement of
straps that held him fast to his mate would
allow; the old sorrel made no attempt to eat.
His harness had slipped down his side and
one of his front legs was caught in a loop in
one of the straps that hung from his neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>The weary old sorrel had hardly regained
his breath, when Queen spied a man on horseback
coming after the pair. The herd dashed
away to the north while White-black, dragging
the exhausted sorrel behind him, brought
up the rear. The old sorrel did the best he
could. The lines tying his bridle to White-black’s
bridle pulled painfully at his lips,
the corners of which were red with blood.
Strength was ebbing rapidly from him and he
moved through space as if he were dazed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly one of his front legs went into a
badger hole. The old fellow went down with
a groan. The groan was immediately followed
by several sharp, successive snaps and
White-black was free from his poor,
wretched, old mate. And the poor old sorrel,
too, was free, free from all future agony.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hanging straps impeded White-black’s
flight, but the darkness came to his rescue.
The herd had ceased running. The hoof-beats
of the man’s saddle pony were dying
away in the distance. By morning when the
man reappeared on the horizon, White-black,
still burdened by his heavy harness, was free
enough to be able to keep up with the herd,
for what was left of the lines, stepped upon
so many times during the night, now hung
above his knees.</p>

<p class='c003'>For more than a week, the man persisted
in his futile attempt to catch the white horse;
then, because his saddle pony was completely
exhausted, racing daily with the weight on
his back, he gave up the chase with a vicious
hope that White-black would strangle himself
in the harness he carried with him, and a
curse upon the wild western broncos that
were “no good anyway.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But White-black had no inclination to pass
out of existence that way, nor did his notion
of value coincide with that of his would-be
owner. He did everything he could think of
doing to rid himself of his trying encumbrance.
He would lie down every once in a
while and roll in the hope of thus rubbing the
harness off. In time, he managed to loosen
the crupper so that it let the greater part of
the harness, the part that covered his back and
sides, slip down on one side of him and drag
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>This only intensified his discomfort, for
every horse that went near him was sure to
step on some strap. Every time some one
stepped upon a strap, however, there was one
strap less dragging after him, and in a few
days the whole network of straps was torn
from the hames. One day while he was grazing,
the hames suddenly loosened and fell off
and the collar fell down upon his head. A
little help with one hoof got it completely off
his head, and so he was free from all but the
bridle. The bit was tormenting enough but
since it did not entirely prevent his grazing
and his drinking, and the straps hanging down
did not interfere with his running, he was virtually
free again.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was during the middle of the winter that
he was relieved of this last link in the chain
of his captivity. There came a severe blizzard
that kept them lying huddled into each
other with nothing to do for a long time.
Queen had always been annoyed by these
straps that clung to White-black and lying
close to him, she stretched her neck and began
to chew at them. While she chewed at the
straps, White-black ground his teeth in his
persistent effort to dislodge the bit, and suddenly
it fell from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c003'>When next spring the homesteader, in another
vain attempt to recapture his valuable
white horse, got near enough to the herd to see
that White-black did not have on him a piece
of all the harness with which he had run away,
he could hardly believe his eyes. That night
he told his neighbours:</p>

<p class='c003'>“That mare’s got the devil in her. She
just took them there harness right off him. I
know it. How else could he get ’em off?
When the critters ran away they both had all
their harness on. How in thunder did he get
his bridle off? Tell me that! She’s a devil,
that mare! I’ll tell y’u she went for me like
a witch the day I got her colt. I went away
and left her round the barn thinkin’ I’d get
her with the help of Colter; but I reckoned
on her bein’ a mare—not a devil! She
opened her mouth just like a wolf. I swear
it!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Because she was able to defend herself
against man’s tyranny, they accused her of
having the devil in her; because she was wise
enough to retain her liberty, they cursed and
hated her. Yet they had ample reason for
hating her. Within two years after the loss
of White-black, not a homesteader dared release
his horses in the fall as they had been in
the habit of doing. To release them was in all
probability to lose them.</p>

<p class='c003'>But keeping them in the barns all winter
meant the necessity for gathering much
greater quantities of hay than they were accustomed
to gather, and, worse than that, it
meant horses with less energy for seeding time
in the spring.</p>

<p class='c003'>Every spring, all manner of attempts were
made to capture Queen but every attempt
ended in costly failure. Some of the older
and weaker horses were taken from the herd
each year, but Queen and all the younger
horses remained free. Once Queen learned
that she was being pursued, it was impossible
for them to get within a mile of her.</p>

<p class='c003'>When these futile attempts to capture her
became too annoying, Queen would invariably
turn to the north. The ominous barbed wire
fences which year after year encroached upon
the wild, somehow never appeared on the
northern horizon. North, always north, she
went, maneuvering with such cunning about
the hills and through the deeper valleys, that
for every mile she was able to put between
herself and her pursuers, they were obliged
to travel five.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Canadian Government embarked upon
a campaign of advertisement to urge farmers
in the United States to go north and take up
homesteads in Alberta. Men sold their farms
in the northwestern states and moved across
the border. Every year a new crop of homesteader’s
shacks appeared to baffle the desolation.
To be sure, many a shack built hopefully
one year stood gaping like a skull the
next; but in spite of the discouraging features
of the country, much of the encroachment
yearly made upon Queen’s domains was permanent.</p>

<p class='c003'>Every springtime with the blossoming of
the wild rosebushes and the prairie cacti, new
fence posts with their glittering lines of
barbed wire cut some small portion of her territory
on the east, the south and the west.
Slowly man crept northward and with an inborn
faith in the justice and the security of
the wilds, Queen fled at his approach.</p>

<div class='c016'>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE years rolled by. Old tragic hurts
were dulled by the mists of passing
time and every hour of the unfettered
present came bringing some new joy.
New children came to Queen and in
the love of each succeeding one, Queen rejoiced
as if it were the first and only one.
Carefully she led them all to the doorway of
maturity and there, since life willed it so,
she gave them over to the herd, to live and
provide for themselves and to abide by the
unwritten laws of the herd in the finest exemplification
of the Golden Rule on earth. The
friends who died or who suddenly disappeared
she would miss for a long while, sometimes
spending months in search of them, then
she would transfer her love of them to some
other member of the brotherhood, just as she
transferred her mother-love from the older
to the younger of her offspring.</p>

<p class='c003'>The shadowy creatures of the receding past
often came, walking into the dozing memory
at nightfall. Queen would remain lying,
chewing absent-mindedly and watching them,
her contentment undisturbed, loving the sadness
that clung to them, as we love the sadness
that clings to our sweetest music.</p>

<p class='c003'>There came a spring of unusual activity on
the part of man, and his daily appearance intruded
so threateningly upon the herd, that
they abandoned the land which had become
endeared to them and journeyed north almost
steadily for many days.</p>

<p class='c003'>They came upon a pleasant valley abounding
in delicious, virgin grass and many small
ponds; and they took possession of it. But
at midnight, while they were resting, they
were suddenly aroused by a shrieking noise
which was followed by a long-drawn rattle,
like distant thunder.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sound died out and did not come again,
but an attenuated cloud of smoke swept across
the valley. Though the rest of that night
was undisturbed and the air, from then on,
was clear, they kept awake and fearfully restless.
At dawn they abandoned the valley
though they saw nothing that was alarming;
and as they moved northward, they came upon
a railroad track.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other side of the track the land
stretched away silent and desolate, merging
at the northern horizon in a long, narrow
shadow, as of woodland. The tracks remained
perfectly motionless and the herd
slowly ventured near them. While some of
the horses looked on curiously, some of the
headstrong young colts to the dismay of their
mothers, walked upon the tracks and sniffed
at them. Seeing that nothing happened to
them, the herd started at once to cross.</p>

<p class='c003'>Half a mile north of that they came upon
another elongated slough which had been
hidden by a hill. Always glad to see water,
they trotted down in concert and took possession,
once more intending to end the journey.
But toward evening while the colts were expressing
the joy of life in a gambol about the
water, they were startled by another shriek
like the one of the night before, and associating
it somehow with the tracks, they tore up
the slope to see what it was.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the distant east glowed a light, like the
harvest moon. It gleamed from the centre
of a black, fear-inspiring object from which
clouds of smoke poured into the air and
streamed backward into space. They gazed
upon it for a few moments as if transfixed,
then when they realised that it was coming
rapidly nearer, they broke down into the valley,
splashing through the slough and sped
up the other slope. On the top of that hill,
they stopped to look back. The thing was
already thundering past them, shutting away
the whole of the south with a long, black line
of smoke in which sparkled a thousand star-like
eyes of fire.</p>

<p class='c003'>Had they remained to look at that line of
smoke, they might have lost the fear of it.
Within a few minutes it went as it had come.
The sweet evening air cleared and settled
down to the silence they loved. But such is
the way of destiny that a thing of smoke and
illusion may wield a power greater than that
of iron or mind.</p>

<p class='c003'>They did not wait long enough to see what
it really was. An impassable wall had arisen
behind them. A guard of ferocious beasts
had rushed across their path, shutting from
them forever the old south world they knew
so well. To Queen it was, in the vaguest
sense, somewhat more than that. The apprehensions
of the moment were dispelled by the
widening distance between them and this
weird thing they feared; but a new anxiety
crept into Queen’s heart, like a snaky creature,
and grew bolder there as the danger it forecast
approached. It was the fear of the
hunted for the cage. It was as if she had entered
an enormous trap and had seen the door
shut upon her.</p>

<p class='c003'>They instinctively kept to a strip of wild
prairie several miles in width. On the eastern
and western horizon they saw from time
to time shacks and barns and fences and huge
squares of black, plowed earth; and from the
distances came at long intervals the muffled
barking of dogs. The feel and the smell of
man was in the air, and they found that air
hard to breathe. They grazed when hunger
asserted itself and rested when the younger
colts refused to go on, but continued their
migration.</p>

<p class='c003'>They came to a country where there were
no shacks and no fences, where the evenness
was broken only by promising patches of
woodland. There the earth seemed destitute
of living things and in the moaning of the
winds as they blew through the swaying trees,
the spirit of loneliness assured them of safety.
The grass on the open spaces grew high as if
no living thing had ever touched it, and swaying
with the trees, it subtly testified to the authenticity
of that assurance. In Queen’s mind,
however, the shacks and the fences and the
barking of dogs were as yet too distinct to
allow her to feel entirely secure; and she
continued the flight, fear urging her to go
on till the last trace of man had faded from
the air and a wall of solitude and wilderness
had covered it. But they came one day to
a very steep slope. Tall trees rose from the
foot of the slope and beyond their tops
Queen saw the reflecting waters of the Saskatchewan
pouring along rapidly from west
to east.</p>

<p class='c003'>The river was very wide and the darker
waters beneath the brighter surface indicated
a perilous depth. The fear of the trap that
had been vague in Queen’s mind now became
distinct as she gazed at the obscure distance
from which the river came and at the shadowy
spaces into which it rushed. Her faith in the
north had given her a decade of precarious
freedom and had taken her two hundred miles
from her birthplace. The sight of those impassable
volumes of water staggered that
faith. She grew nervous and restless and
when the herd had drunk the treacherous
water, she led them away to the west.</p>

<p class='c003'>A half day’s journey brought them to where
the Vermillion River tearing along between
high banks comes pouring down from the
south and the west and breaks into the Saskatchewan,
with a threatening roar. Again
Queen felt that she had come to another wall
of the trap and turning, led the herd back
toward the east. A few days of grazing and
moving east along the Saskatchewan brought
them to a barbed wire fence that ran down
the banks to the very edge of the river. Ever
as she had followed the slightly winding river,
she had searched in vain for a ford. The
doors of the north, too, had closed to them, and
their freedom now depended upon a battle of
wits, the wits of the herd in the limited wilds
against the wits of man in his protecting civilisation.</p>

<p class='c003'>They returned to the middle of the unsettled
belt and there Queen spent a happy week
of freedom, disturbed only by the promptings
of the canker within her which derived its
sustenance from the frequent appearance of
men on horseback.</p>

<p class='c003'>Seeding time arrived and the homesteaders
who lived south of the railroad tracks went
forth to hunt for the horses they had released
the preceding fall. The homesteaders who
lived on the outskirts of these wilds, in the
hope of capturing some of the unclaimed
horses, joined them. But with a cunning that
exasperated the hunters, Queen went from one
hiding place to another, detecting every approach
so long before the horsemen appeared
that in the first full week of searching she was
seen only on two occasions.</p>

<p class='c003'>The homesteaders became desperate. The
snows were fast disappearing and the land
was in best condition for their work. They
appealed to the Canadian Government and
half a dozen members of the Royal Northwest
Mounted Police came out to reinforce them
in the war to the knife that was declared upon
Queen and her followers.</p>

<p class='c003'>Several times a day Queen would run down
the banks of the Saskatchewan. At the river
she would take a few sips of water as if she
had come to drink and then she would stand
and look longingly across the roaring deeps
to the wilds beyond, suppressing the constantly
rising impulse to plunge into the rapid
waters and beat her way to the freedom of the
north, which seemed, after half a lifetime of
benefaction, to have abandoned her. Then
one day the impulse came with overwhelming
suddenness and she struck out madly for the
other shore. But when she felt the bottom
drop away from under her feet, she became
frightened. The remnants of the huge snow
drifts that were still melting kept the river
swollen to twice its volume. The current
lifted her and carried her several rods downstream,
fortunately for her, hitting a bar and
depositing her there.</p>

<p class='c003'>Puffing and snorting and registering the
promise that she would never try it again,
Queen finally clambered back upon the shore
where she shook the water from her body.
Some of the horses who had watched the
whole performance with anxiety, came trotting
toward her. Queen joined them dejectedly,
grateful to be out of the treacherous
water, but remembering that she was being
hunted and realising now that there was no
chance of getting across the river and that
her only hope lay in her delicate legs and the
cunning that many years of resistance to man
had developed.</p>

<p class='c003'>A few days passed by in which all hostilities
on the part of the homesteaders and the
Mounted Police seemed to have ceased.
Queen began to feel that the war had been
abandoned; but she was surprised one very
early morning by a formidable group of
horsemen, less than a quarter of a mile to the
east from where the herd was grazing, who
were coming at full speed. A strong wind
had been blowing from the west and had carried
the scent and sound of them away. A
lull in the wind apprised her of the enemy’s
approach.</p>

<p class='c003'>They had been moving along the edge of
a patch of dense woodland, the wall of which
stretched from the Saskatchewan to a point a
little more than a mile south of the river.
There was no opening between the trees and
the brush. The only chance for escape lay in
a wild dash south and in reaching the end of
the wooded wall before the horsemen could
reach it. That chance they took.</p>

<p class='c003'>The horsemen divided into groups. One
group sped away southwest at an angle, while
another, going straight west, spread out on a
long line to prevent the herd from going
back to the river.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a close race. Every animal, pursuing
or pursued, groaned in the terrible exertion
of it. The younger and the stronger of
the herd led the race, with Queen’s magnificent
head in front. Behind the group of fastest
runners came the mothers with their colts,
and the old work-worn horses brought up the
rear. Though spurs dug unmercifully into
wet, throbbing sides, staining them with small
red spots, the forepart of the herd, unencumbered
by riders, won the end of the wall and
broke away to the west in safety. Not until
the wall point was almost out of sight did they
stop to look back and when Queen finally felt
it safe to do so and swung round a knoll, she
saw no sign of her pursuers; but the far greater
portion of the herd was gone with them.</p>

<p class='c003'>About a mile southwest of where they were,
they knew of a slough. It was down in a
deep hollow and though they would rather
have remained on the hills where they could
more easily spy any one coming after them,
they were very thirsty and trotted away for
water. At the rim of the hollow some of
them stopped to look about before going
down, others broke down on a run.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen drank very little. She was worried
and very nervous. While most of the horses
walked into the pond, looking for deeper and
clearer water, she took a few hasty sips of the
warm, muddy stuff on the edge and then ran
up the slope to take another look. There
seemed to be nothing untoward on the plains,
but to make sure she remained there a while
and grazed.</p>

<p class='c003'>She had not been grazing more than a few
minutes when she was startled by a frantic
splashing in the pond. She looked down in
time to see White-black whose forelegs had
sunk into a mud-hole, attempt to turn round.
Half a dozen of the others began to struggle
just as frantically. Some of them managed
to reach hard ground, but White-black and
two others seemed to sink deeper the harder
they struggled.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first all this violent effort to get out made
her think that some awful danger had suddenly
arisen in the centre of the pond, but the
light grey mud on the flanks of those who did
get out, apprised her of the fact that they had
struck an alkali mud-hole. She had had her
experience with alkali mud-holes before.
They had been in the habit of drinking at the
other end of the slough and had come to this
end now only because the other end was somewhat
nearer to the territory from which they
had just escaped.</p>

<p class='c003'>She hurried down to the side of White-black
and as he resumed his struggling, she
called to him anxiously. Finally the three
of them ceased struggling for a while and set
up a helpless neighing to which those on the
shore responded just as helplessly.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was little danger of drowning for the
water was very shallow, but the fear of being
caught, the fear of the pursued creature still
warm in their throbbing hearts, kept them
struggling and their struggles tired them out
and drove them down deeper into the mud.
Queen was perplexed. It seemed as if everything
were combining for their destruction,
that even the mud joined man in his effort
to torture them. She called to the helpless
creatures ceaselessly, running up and
down the slope in a frenzy of fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly while she was down at the edge
of the pond, urging White-black to exert himself
and White-black was groaning for want
of strength, the wind shifted and brought from
the northwest a message of danger. The
horses who were free ran up the slope to the
southeast. Queen, who was this time behind
the others, suddenly stopped half way up the
slope and turning back called frantically to
White-black. Her life long association with
White-black had endeared him more strongly
to her than the other two and it seemed hard
for her to leave him in distress.</p>

<p class='c003'>She ran back to the edge of the water,
stamping her foot and calling with all her
strength; but White-black only weakened
himself. One of the two other horses, in a
violent last effort, pulled himself half way
out, and dropped back, but White-black
ceased trying.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hoof beats of the free horses faded
away in the distance and their rhythmic patter
was followed by those of the enemy’s horses.
A man’s head appeared at the rim of the hollow
and with a last call to White-black, Queen
shot up the slope and away to the southwest.
The men had seen the other horses first and
had veered to go after them, when they discovered
Queen. Trying to head her off, one
man started down the slope and as he did so
he discovered White-black and his two companions
struggling in the mud.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Queen fled she heard the one man
whistling to the others. She could not hear
anyone behind her but she did not stop to find
out whether she was being followed or not.
In the distant west she saw the shadowy blue
of a clump of trees and she made for that with
every bit of strength left in her. When she
reached the trees she first shot under cover,
then investigating to make sure that no dangerous
animal was hidden there, or that no
men were coming from any other direction,
she pushed her way out to a thicket of buffalo
berries, and stopped to scan the plains she
had covered.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not a living thing stirred on the monotonous
level of the prairies. Only heat waves
danced above the narrow, blue strips of woodland
shadows. Within a few minutes she
was convinced that no one was coming after
her and then despite her fear and restlessness,
and her anxiety to get back to the other horses
that had escaped, she sank down to the ground,
snorting and panting like a dog. But within
half an hour she was off again in pursuit of
the remnant of the herd.</p>

<p class='c003'>All through the afternoon she hunted them,
stopping often to graze and to drink, now
trotting, now loping, going fast when something
on the horizon made her think that she
had found them or walking slowly when she
realised that she had been mistaken; calling
often, sometimes with all her strength as if
she hoped they would hear her and sometimes
calling softly and hopelessly only because she
felt an urge to express the feeling that had
taken complete possession of her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Toward evening when the light began fading
and the shadows grew long, she trotted
cautiously to the pond where she had left
White-black in the mud. The desire to find
him grew stronger as the evening progressed
toward night and Queen went at full speed.</p>

<p class='c003'>The unruffled surface of the pond was
brightly reflecting the last rays of daylight
when she turned over the rim of the hollow
and stopped there to make sure that the men
were gone. Even those thoughtless men who
hated her—they were not many—if they had
been able to see her as she slowly came walking
over the rim a step at a time, would have
admired that beautiful head in the evening
silhouette with its touch of magnificence and
the cunning that had kept her out of their
greedy reach.</p>

<p class='c003'>A few ducks were moving about in the glitter.
Immediately upon seeing her they rose
into the air and flew away. Queen trotted
down to the muddy edge where White-black
had been trapped. The mud that was not
covered with water was stippled with countless
hoof prints. Here and there on the
stippled surface she saw impressions of the
whole side of a horse and she knew that the
horses had fallen many times after coming
out of the mud-hole. Some of these impressions
still bore the scent of White-black and
Queen excitedly read the story of his struggle
with his captors. For some time she walked
round the slough, stopping now and then to
sniff or to break the heavy silence by long and
nervous whinnies, then realising the futility
of her going round the slough and feeling
suddenly a sense of confinement in the hollow,
she went up the slope and on the rim began
to feed.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ducks came back. They flew directly
over her to see just what she was. Assured
that she was neither man nor coyote, they
swept down to the water’s surface, touching it
gracefully with a melodious splash. Queen
lifted her head a trifle above the grass and
stared at them thoughtfully. The sight of the
little black objects sailing about in the bright
reflection of the sky and the occasional murmur
that came from them out of the stillness,
gladdened her. She felt somewhat less alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a hard night for Queen. She needed
rest very badly but she was much too apprehensive
and too lonely to rest well. When
the ducks late in the night flew away, the hollow
became unbearable to her and she wandered
off over the plains searching and calling
and tiring herself out.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the day she rested some, then from
one end of the wilds to the other she rambled,
searching for her companions and finding
only fences and lifeless shacks which stood on
the level distances, stony sentinels forever
barring her way with threat of captivity.
Along the east side of her desolated domains
she followed fence after fence for days without
coming upon a trace of the herd. With
eyes alert for the first sign of man, she stuck
to the east, because she knew that her captured
followers had all been taken in that direction.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came to where the fence broke into two
parts leaving an open roadway between. She
entered the roadway cautiously and walked
farther and farther, scanning the distances as
she went. But when she had gone half a mile,
the feeling of having fences on both sides and
so near to her, began to worry her and she
turned and raced back for the wilds.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she saw, however, that the avenue
had not closed upon her, she walked in again.
She went about a mile this time and spied a
group of horses in one of these wiry enclosures.
She started away in great haste, but
soon stopped still. There was a man’s shack
only a quarter of a mile away from where the
horses were and she was afraid to go. She
called to them emotionally but besides raising
their heads to look her way, they made no
attempt to come to her, and when she called
again a dog came out of the shack and started
in her direction barking ferociously.</p>

<p class='c003'>On her way out of the avenue through
which she had come, she noticed half a mile
from the furthest point she had reached, that
the wires turned leaving her another open
avenue through which she could approach the
group of horses on the other side of the fence
and very much farther from the shack. Very
cautiously and very nervously she followed
that avenue, stopping very often to make sure
that she hadn’t already been trapped, and
when she reached the other side of the fence,
some of the horses who had been watching
her, came forward to meet her. Here the
fence ended completely and when she saw the
plains stretch from there unfenced, she lost
a good deal of her fear and trotted in their
direction, calling eagerly as she ran.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen was so excited when a dozen noses
reached over the wires to greet her that she
cut herself several times on the barbs without
knowing that she had cut herself. Having
greeted her, however, the confined horses
went on grazing; while Queen capered about
on the outside, calling again and again and
reaching over the wires recklessly, to the consternation
of the strangers who would just
raise their heads a moment, look at her curiously
and go on about their business.</p>

<p class='c003'>White-black was not there and those whom
she recognised were all horses that had but
the fall before attached themselves to her
herd. But she was happy to see them and to
be with them and grazed with a better appetite
than she had had for a long time. She
grazed just outside of the fence, moving along
as they moved within.</p>

<p class='c003'>She spent the night there outside of the
fence and though the group of horses kept
walking away considerably they were yet near
enough to dispel the gloom and the loneliness
that had been hanging over her world since
the herd had been taken from her. It was
the pleasantest night she had had for some
time. Queen intended to remain there outside
that fence; but she was discovered next
morning by a man who came for some of the
horses and his dog went after her. At first for
fear of the man, she ran as fast as she could go,
the dog at her heels; but when she got to where
she was no longer afraid of the man, she turned
upon the dog, striking at him with a lifted foot.
She did not hit him but he did not wait for her
second attempt. He fled surprised and badly
frightened, yelping for help.</p>

<p class='c003'>She experienced a good deal of satisfaction
over his cowardly departure; but she was
afraid of the man who seemed to be coming in
her direction and who was calling loudly to
the dog; and so she ran away. The experience
of the night was like a clue to her in her
search for her companions. From there she
went to other fences. Fences were hateful
things but they were also hopeful affairs and
she expected to find her friends in one of them.
Thus she penetrated farther and farther into
man’s dominion. Over the endless, deviating
roadways, between the endless lines of fence
posts and the treacherous barbed wire, always
alert, she went, confident that she could find
her way out in case of danger. When she
would come upon a group of horses in some
fence she would follow them on the outside,
grazing as they grazed and lying down when
they were near her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She did not find those of her companions
whom she was most anxious to find, and those
that she did come upon, though they always
replied to her, did not always come to her
when she called. Queen began to feel
vaguely and painfully that her influence was
gone, that her regency was over. Like the
dethroned leader that she was, she accepted
the censure that was due her for having
failed, with almost evident humility.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her loneliness became harder to bear. She
wearied of the life of interminable limitations
and the fence posts on all sides of her began
to hurt her as if the roadways had steadily
grown narrower and the barbs had penetrated
her skin.</p>

<p class='c003'>So she started back toward the west,
toward the wilds she loved, hoping that there
she might find the rest of the herd where the
herd by the natural right of things belonged.
When she was back again upon the unsettled
wilds she was happier for a while; but as she
went from one familiar spot to another—the
pond where White-black had been trapped,
the various patches and strips of woodland
where they used to hide or spend their nights,
and the river—the loneliness grew heavier in
her heart and Queen began to lose interest in
life. Grass and water there was plenty, but
the taste could no longer derive complete satisfaction
from grass and water. After every
mouthful she cropped she would lift her head
and look so wistfully over the spaces that she
would forget to chew the grass between her
teeth. She would start off and gallop away
over the prairie as if she had suddenly thought
of some place where she was sure she would
find her companions and just as suddenly she
would stop and continue to graze.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her loneliness became unendurable. It
seemed to have peopled the solitudes with invisible
creatures bent upon harming her.
She was afraid to rest, afraid even to graze or
drink. Once more she took to the labyrinthine
avenues between fence posts, penetrating with
impassioned eagerness the very heart of the
homesteading district, seeing many homesteaders’
shacks and fighting many dogs, becoming
reckless as she became accustomed to
them. Often as these remote farmers plowed
their fields, they would hear her call, sometimes
finding her only a few rods behind
them; and their horses fettered as they were
in their harness would turn their heads and
reply to her. When a farmer set his dog
upon her she would fight him; but when the
farmer himself started for her, she would lope
away and he would not see her again for many
days.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came upon a small group of horses in
an enclosed pasture, one day, among whom
she spied the brown stallion and a little bay
mare who had nestled close to her many a cold
winter night. This pasture was farther in the
area of wire fences than Queen had ever gone
before. As soon as she called, the group
started in her direction. She was so overwhelmed
by the familiar scents of those she
knew that she could not control herself.
First she ran along the fence a while, then
she deliberately trotted away from the fence.
Going off for a few rods and coming back at
full speed she leaped over the wires. Though
she was slightly cut on one of her hind
legs, she landed safely in the midst of the
group.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were as happy to see her as she was
to see them and the expression of their excitement
and joy attracted the attention of the
farmer and his dog in the shack a quarter of
a mile away. She was sniffing noses with a
grey horse whom she had mistaken in the distance
for White-black, when she caught sound
of the barking of the farmer’s dog, and turned
to see him coming toward her.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was a big, ferocious-looking, wolf-like
dog, much bigger than the average coyote and
many times as savage. At his approach, the
other horses started away but Queen, who was
not ready to part from her companions again
so soon, stopped to fight him. He remained
a short distance away from her, barking angrily,
turning his head backward now and
then as if he waited for reinforcement, his
eyes glaring at her threateningly. The other
horses had turned about and stopped to watch
the battle, and Queen, feeling encouraged by
their watching, waited for him to come
nearer.</p>

<p class='c003'>But suddenly, taking her eyes off the beast
for just a moment, she saw two men lead two
saddle ponies into the barbed wire enclosure
and she made a dash for the fence, hoping to
jump over it before they arrived. Just as
soon as she started off the dog rushed at her
with a bark and a snarl. In terror of him,
she turned to strike at him with her hoof, but
as soon as she turned the dog sprang out of
reach. When she turned once more for the
fence the dog seized her tail. She struck him
with a hind leg. He let go his hold of the
tail and dug his fangs into her leg.</p>

<p class='c003'>Had there been no men coming, she might
have fought it out with him. As it was they
were already racing toward her and in desperation,
Queen loped after the rest of the
horses who were now stampeding away to the
other end of the pasture. When she reached
her companions she plunged into their midst
as if she expected them to protect her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The men first drove the entire group to the
corner nearest to the shack and there setting
the dog upon her they separated her from the
other horses. They continued to urge the dog
to go at her and his ferocious teeth and the
nerve wracking noise he was making so confused
her that she stopped to fight him almost
disregarding the two men, whose ropes, as she
faced the dog, sailed over and dropped upon
her head.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ropes so alarmed her that she paid no
more attention to the dog. She reared in an
effort to pull her head from the loops but this
only tightened their hateful grip. While she
was uselessly struggling the men slipped from
their saddles and fastened the ends of their
ropes to a fence post on each side of the corner.
Then slowly they pulled the ropes in,
forcing her back. Despite the pain it gave
her, Queen tugged and pulled and reared.
The men then got some more ropes from a
boy who came with them from the shack and
with these new ropes they first caught a front
leg and after a long struggle caught a hind
one, then pulling on the ropes they threw her
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>She fell with a sickening thud. A spell of
dizziness came upon her and she half shut her
eyes as consciousness began slipping from her.
But fear and assailing odours brought her to
her senses. She made a violent effort to continue
the struggle, but a man leaped for her
head and seized her nose bone with both his
hands. With a quick twist he turned her nose
upward and she lay absolutely helpless. She
snorted and groaned but she could not rise.
She felt the bony fingers of the man gripping
her nose bone and felt the other man winding
ropes about her legs.</p>

<p class='c003'>What they wanted with her she could not
know. She thought of the coyote as she had
seen him sitting over and feasting upon her
colt. Her skin quivered all over her body
and she tried once more to throw off the appalling
weights that kept her down; but her
attempts only proved to her how hopelessly
she was in their power, how easy it was for
them to do just what they liked with her.
She expected them at any moment to begin
tearing the flesh from her body.</p>

<p class='c003'>The smell of man was nauseating, their
voices were terrifying and it seemed as if she
just could not endure the pain that the man’s
fingers gave her as they dug round her nose
bone; yet worse than all this was the smoke
and the smell of fire that suddenly filled the
atmosphere, bringing terrors out of her darkened
past to help in her torture.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly she felt a pain that was worse
than any pain she had ever experienced in her
life before. They were pressing some terrible
instrument into her shoulder, an instrument
that penetrated the skin like the teeth
of a dog but a thousand times more painfully.
All her hatred, all her fear combined, and
with a strength that the greedy men admired
she began to struggle again. As she struggled,
the man gripped tighter on her nose bone
and the pain of his digging fingers took her
mind off the burning pain in her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she least expected it, the man sprang
away from her head, leaving it free. She
made an attempt at once to get back upon her
feet, but her legs were still tied and she fell
back again to the ground. She raised her
head and glared fearfully at her tormentors.
In the far distance she caught a glimpse of
the other horses, grazing indifferently. The
two men stood a few feet away, looking down
upon her and talking to each other.</p>

<p class='c003'>The smell of her burnt flesh in the welter
of nauseating odours, the pain in her shoulder
growing momentarily worse, the lack of excitement
on the part of the men, the cool deliberateness
with which they seemed to have
gone about her torture, together with the fear
of what they were yet to do, bewildered
Queen; and out of this bewilderment emerged
a feeling that was worse than fear or pain, a
feeling that was an ally of both, the feeling
of submission. But Queen’s submission was
not a servile one. Rather was it like the retreat
of the general who hopes for a more
propitious moment in which to strike again
and strike with all his rallied force.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man who was, without any further
doubt, stronger than she was might burn her
flesh; he might tie her legs so that she could
not get up; he might force his sharp fingers
about her nose bone and torturously twist her
head so that she would be helpless; but he
could not control or limit her hate. And hate
boiled in her blood and burned like a fever
in her body, restraining itself only as the tiger
restrains his desire before he springs upon
his prey.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
QUEEN was branded! A large letter
<i>B</i> had been burned through the hair
and almost through the skin on her
right shoulder. The red hot metal
had broken through the skin in several
spots on the curves and from these spots
oozed drops of blood. The air constantly
passing over the wound kept the pain of it at
its original intensity.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ropes gave way. The two men stepped
away quickly. Queen thought for a moment
that she was free. The ropes were still hanging
from her neck but they were hanging
loosely. She sprang to her feet. A hasty
look around made her think, foolishly, that
she could now get away. She leaped forward
eagerly and at once realised her mistake. The
ropes became taut. A front leg was drawn
back to one of the hind legs and she went
down on one side with a shock that seemed to
have disturbed every organ in her body.</p>

<p class='c003'>She remained lying down but raised her
head. With large round eyes, radiating fear
and hate, she looked from one to the other of
her little captors as if she were seeking some
vulnerable point for attack; but they were
standing calmly and their calmness bespoke
their power. Nearby the fire that had heated
the irons was still smouldering, poisoning the
air with its pungent significance.</p>

<p class='c003'>For a few moments Queen remained comparatively
still. Their obvious power over
her crushed and confused her. From her
shoulder came the painful reminder of her
captivity; and somehow, this gnawing pain,
more than the ropes that gripped her neck
and feet, brought her the overwhelming conviction
that she was as much their property as
the body of her first beloved colt had been
the property of the coyote that had sat and
feasted over it.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the rest of her flesh would be torn
from her body as she felt a piece had already
been torn from her shoulder, there was no
doubt in her mind. But Queen had fought
many battles and though the pain of the
brand was inescapable and unforgetable,
though that moment she was well-nigh hopeless,
she still watched for her chance to get
away.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she got up again she was afraid to
move a foot. One of the men pulled on the
rope that gripped her neck. Queen expected
to be hurt again. She braced herself against
the earth with all four legs, and pulled back.
A severe lash on the haunch sent her limping
to the side. The man behind followed her
while the man in front ran off a few paces
ahead, and pulled again. Several repetitions
of this performance brought her to the open
gateway of the fence. Near the gateway was
the house and beyond the house was the barn.
Experience had taught her to keep away from
men’s shacks and the smell of the barn where
she had once seen White-black, and her colt
had been imprisoned, came back faintly and
called upon her to resist. There were the
men about her. There was the boy and at his
heels, barking ferociously, was the dog. But
in spite of them she made another attempt to
get away and once more earned a violent
throw to the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fall this time stunned her. She
stretched out her head and lay motionless a
moment, breathing very heavily and groaning
as if she were dying. The man behind her
struck her with his rope. Her skin quivered
and another groan forced its way out between
her clenched teeth. Her consciousness came
back slowly. She heard the barking of the
dog and the voices of the men and above their
voices the shriller voice of the boy. She was
sick at her heart and stomach. She felt as if
she didn’t care what they did any more. But
a very severe blow with the end of the rope
striking a tender spot on her flanks brought
her to her senses. She felt as if a wave of
cold water had swept over her. She managed
to get to her feet. As she stood, bewildered,
not knowing what to do, and feeling
the terrible necessity of doing something, her
whole body shook with an uncontrollable
tremour.</p>

<p class='c003'>The injustice of all this torture aroused an
insane resentment; and, casting a glance over
the silent prairies that stretched away to the
hazy horizon, within her grasp, yet cruelly
denied her, she leaped toward the open with
all her waning strength, so suddenly and so
unexpectedly that the man behind her, clinging
to the rope, was thrown to the ground and
the man in front barely escaped her front
legs.</p>

<p class='c003'>The cries of men and boy and dog broke
fearfully upon her ears and the ferocious dog
leaped at her throat. He fell back without
having touched her but she lifted a hoof to
strike him and thus pulling on the rope that
tied that foot to a hind leg she threw herself
to the ground. She fell outside of the gateway
and within a dozen yards of the barn-door
which stood gapingly open and black, ready
to swallow her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man behind her beat her with his rope
and kicked her unmercifully; but even if she
could have risen she would not have done so;
and they finally decided to let her rest a while.</p>

<p class='c003'>The beating commenced all over again and
she was forced to her feet. With another
swing of the rope she started off nervously before
it struck her. The man in front ran on
each time she went forward and in that way
they got her to the barn-door. But she was
afraid to enter. The boy had brought the
man behind her a whip and when that came
down upon her back raising a welt, she involuntarily
rushed into the barn to escape it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thus they got her into a stall and tied her
securely. One man got into the manger and
against all her fearful protestations managed
to force a halter upon her head. With
double ropes tied to the ring of the halter they
tied two rope ends to each side of the manger,
then removed the ropes with which they
had first tied her; and she almost killed one
of the men in the process. Finally, they left
her alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was so dark and damp and dirty in the
barn. The foul smells were revolting.
When her eyes became accustomed to the
gloom she made out a horse, chewing contentedly
a short distance away, and the sight
of him relieved her immeasurably. She
called to him but he went on chewing and
ignored her call. Queen was hurt. She
looked at him sadly, then half closed her eyes.
But in a few minutes she called to him again
and more forcibly. This time the old glutton
replied to her but with little enthusiasm,
rather with annoyance, for he didn’t like it a
bit that she made him take time from his
chewing to reply to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ropes did not allow her to see him very
well, but she watched him a moment out of
the corner of her eye and felt as she watched
him that somehow he was in league with man,
the usurper of her liberty. She hated him
and looked no more in his direction. Over
her came full force the horror of her bondage
and the fearful realisation that her every effort
to escape it would prove futile. Yet her
thoughts contradicted each other and where
some images came out of her memory and experience
and supported her fear, others came
just as strongly and allayed it. She remembered,
for instance, White-black tied in his
stall in the sod barn where her colt had been
imprisoned and then she saw him coming over
the plains tied to the old sorrel work-horse.
So she saw him in many happier moods on the
open plains long after that. Together with
the endless stream of sensations of pain, from
the wound on her shoulder and from other
wounds on her body, came visions of familiar
nooks on the prairies and in the woods. Like
ghosts these visions came through the smelling
darkness and haunted her.</p>

<p class='c003'>At times these visions drove her frantic and
she would pull and tug and tear and kick till
her energy was spent and after every momentary
storm there was some new wound to torment
her. There was a deep gash on her
upper lip that bothered her almost as much
as the burn on her shoulder, for blood kept
trickling from it into her nose and mouth and
the taste and the smell of blood were as tormenting
as the pain.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man came back. She heard him coming
and her eyes began to blaze again and her
sides throbbed for fear. He walked around
to the front of the manger and approaching
her head, extended a hand carefully. She
pulled her head back as far as the ropes would
allow her and snorted with fright. He said
something to her angrily and she listened in
terror to the sound of his voice. He made
another attempt to touch her with his hand,
but this time she threateningly bared her
teeth. He withdrew his hand quickly and
lifting the long end of one of her ropes he
struck her with it. It hit the sore on her
upper lip and Queen pulling on the ropes with
all her might, cried out for pain.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then the second man appeared and the boy
and the dog came behind him. Queen expected
a new battle, but they only brought her
hay and water. They stood near the manger
watching her and talking. They took handfuls
of hay and touched her lips with it but
she only shook her head violently and whinnied
fearfully. So, too, she disdained the
water they gave her. The man seemed to
know that she wanted the water, however, and
so he set the pail down into the manger.
When they finally went out Queen looked
after them anxiously.</p>

<p class='c003'>Night came down. The man came back
again and offered her some oats in his hands;
but even if she had desired to eat the oats, the
smell of his hands would have destroyed that
desire. Seeing that she had touched neither
hay nor water he threw the oats into the hay
and walked away. Suddenly as she looked
sideways, she saw the man lead the horse out
of the barn. It was too dark to see clearly
but she could feel that the horse was going
out and she could hear the tread of his heavy
feet. Forgetting all her previous emotions,
Queen shamelessly begged him to return and
the terror in her voice seemed to break up the
shadows that filled the barn into monstrous
creatures which she felt were surrounding her.
She called again and again till the fear of the
sound of her own voice finally hushed her.
She hoped that the horse would return and
waited and listened for his coming, but he did
not return. Faint queer sounds of scratching
came from above and behind her. Chickens
roosting somewhere in the darkness tortured
her with their sleepy peeping. And a bat flying
around the barn, buzzing every few moments
near her head, kept her nerves on edge. But
when the dog came into the barn, Queen went
mad. She had fought coyotes and dogs but she
had never been helplessly tied before. She
pulled at her ropes and kicked with her legs
till she shattered one of the crate-like sides of
her stall and tore the top board of her manger
loose at one end.</p>

<p class='c003'>The frightened dog ran out of the barn and
barked so loud he brought the man from the
house. Queen heard him coming and when
she saw rays of light break through the cracks
in the walls, she almost jumped over the manger.
He opened the door and a flood of light
poured into the barn and when he began to
talk to her she calmed down a bit.</p>

<p class='c003'>He retied her and fixed the broken board
of the manger. She seemed to fear him less
now than before and as he talked she listened,
her eyes fixed as if fascinated on the
lantern he had hung up not far from her head.
Suddenly the dog reappeared. Queen jumped
involuntarily. The man kicked the dog and
the dog ran out of the barn crying for pain.
It was then that the first slight sense of gratefulness
came over Queen; but it left her with
the man’s going out and gave way to the
puzzle of his strange light, which for some
time obscured everything else in her mind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The night dragged horribly and when dawn
came at last she was exhausted. She saw the
barn-door open and was relieved by the
shower of daylight. Though the man came
into the barn and seemed to have much to do
there, he did not come near her. Chickens
moved around her, some of them even jumping
up on her manger to pick the grains of
oats that she had refused, and Queen watched
them with interest. For a while she was
afraid of them, but their contented sing-songs
as they ceaselessly searched for food bespoke
their harmlessness.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man had gone out and Queen was dozing
from sheer exhaustion when the boy appeared.
He came over to Queen’s manger
and seized the ropes, drawing her head toward
him. She resisted as best she could and because
she bared her teeth when he tried to
touch her with his hand, opening her mouth
as with the intention of biting him just as soon
as the hand was near enough, he let go his
hold on the rope and picking up a stick began
to prod her with it. At first she just struggled
to pull her head out of reach of the stick
but when he persisted she became furious.
Snorting and whinnying she kicked right and
left against her stall and the boy, afraid that
his father would come in, quietly sneaked out
of the barn.</p>

<p class='c003'>All day she stood stolidly without touching
the hay, drinking a little of the ill-tasting
water only when alone and when she could
not resist the desire for it. When night came
again Queen began feeling most uneasy about
the shadows and the strange nocturnal sounds;
yet she seemed more able to endure this night
than the first. When the second dawn appeared
she was partially resigned to her evil-smelling
confinement; but the monotony of
standing on her feet in one place, standing,
standing, standing endlessly, like a new kind
of pain was far more distracting than bodily
pain.</p>

<p class='c003'>The pain of the brand seemed to grow dull
and then it bothered her only when the healing
wound touched something. The other
pains in the many places about her body also
kept growing less tormenting; but these tortures
of the first days of her captivity gave
way to the less perturbative, more gnawing
anguish of imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Calls of distant horses sometimes penetrated
her prison and Queen would make the
very walls surrounding her tremble with the
agony of her aimless replies. So, too, wafts
bearing familiar fragrance often strayed into
the smelling atmosphere of the barn, rekindling
smouldering fires. The love of the
plains, the desire to lope over them with the
freedom she had retained so long would at
those times seize upon her with maddening
hold and she would kick and pull till she
hurt herself or until she realised once more,
each new time more forcefully than the last,
that all her storming was as futile as it was
hurtful.</p>

<p class='c003'>So Queen began to learn. She learned to
eat the dead hay even though the dirt often
mixed with it was revolting. She learned to
drink the water though the taste and the smell
of it was nauseating. “You’ll get over your
fussiness,” the man often said to her when he
came into the barn. Fortunately Queen did
not understand what he said and the resentment
she would have experienced, had she
understood, never interfered with her “getting
over it.” It was really better for Queen, as it
is in similar circumstances sometimes better
for us, to “get over it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But her “getting over it” was always a matter
of weights and measures. Every pain set
itself against some other pain and the stronger
pain conquered her aversions. When so
weary standing that her legs ached in the
joints, carrying the weight of her body, she
lay down the first time. The smell of the
floor was so loathsome that she got up again
after a few minutes. She remained standing
till the pain became more tormenting than
the smell of the floor, and then lay down again,
learning to endure the smell. And it proved
to be a valuable lesson in so far as it divided
the endlessly dragging hours in half. Instead
of standing all day and all night shifting
the weight of her body from foot to foot,
she would stand one hour and lie down for
one hour and thus broke the killing completeness
of the excruciating monotony.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hay was constantly replaced when she
had eaten what was in her manger and the
pail was always refilled with water when she
had drained it. This in time seemed to assure
her that they did not mean to destroy her or
that destruction was not going to take place immediately.
Her hatred for man did not lose its
intensity but her experience relegated it to
some more distant corner of her soul, moved
it from where it had dominated the whole of
her consciousness so that she could endure
her bondage as she waited for the opportunity
to escape it.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
ONE day while Queen, for want of
something better to do, was dozing
over her empty manger from which
she had eaten up every spire of hay,
she heard the dog, outside, bark with
unusual excitement. By the increasing rapidity
with which his barks succeeded each other,
she knew that something was coming. She
soon heard the rumbling of a wagon and when
that sound came very close and stopped it was
followed by the clatter of many voices. She
had allowed herself to worry about many
sounds that had resulted in no harm to her
and experience was teaching her not to worry.
So she soon went back to her dozing, especially
since the rapid patter of hoofs, as the horses
drawing the wagon pulled into the yard, had
quickened her memory of life with the herd.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the midst of her dreaming she was suddenly
disturbed by the entrance of two strange
horses whose heavy feet beat the floor of the
barn so hard that she felt every beat. The
harness on these two huge horses was massy
and bits of metal on it flashed with the reflection
of the light of the doorway. They were
led into the stall next to Queen and with absolute
indifference to her they began to rummage
in the manger and the oats boxes, calling
greedily for food. Queen watched them
with no little interest. She was afraid of the
men who had come in with them but in spite
of the men she could not resist the desire to
touch noses with the horse nearest to her.
She pushed her nose anxiously through an
opening in the partition and the big horse
touched it with his nose a moment, but immediately
returned to his voracious search
for oats. But the touch of the big nose had
only intensified the burning desire in her heart
for companionship, and she called more
loudly and with greater appeal.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly, she felt a slap upon her back and
when she almost flounced into her manger in
fright, she heard laughter behind her. The
man who had slapped her then went round
to the front of the manger and when Queen’s
eyes fell upon him she recognised him. It was
he who had helped the man of the place capture
and brand her. The smell of him was
most repellent and she backed away as far
as she could go; but he untied her ropes and
pulling their ends together, around a steading
of the back wall of the manger, he pulled
on them, dragging her forward till her knees
struck the manger, and her head was over
his shoulder as he stooped. He held on to
the ropes keeping her head immovable; while
her owner, coming from the other end of the
barn with a bunch of straps, threw them upon
her head.</p>

<p class='c003'>She struggled desperately to pull her head
away but the ropes were relentless. The evil-smelling
hands of her owner moved all over
her face and she was powerless even to show
her resentment. His big thumb forced its
way between her teeth and while her jaws
were apart a piece of iron slipped in between
her teeth; and before she could dislodge it, the
straps were forced over her ears and fastened
around her neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>With teeth and tongue she struggled to
eject the annoying iron from her mouth but
try as she would she could not move it to the
edge of her teeth. They then loosened the
ropes and her owner seized them all with one
hand. Taking the reins which hung from the
bridle bit in the other hand, he jumped over
the manger. Seeing him she sprang back
nervously and he followed her. She started
for the doorway and when she got out into
the open, she was going a little too fast for
him. With a vicious jerk on the reins he
halted her. The iron in her mouth was bent in
the centre and the least jerk on the reins forced
the bend to strike the tender palate with the
force of a hammer.</p>

<p class='c003'>The full light of day to which she was no
longer accustomed hurt her eyes and her limbs
seemed stiff, the joints paining her with the
exertion of her first activity in so long a time.
A wagon stood not far off with its tongue
extended before it. On the seat was a fur robe.
It appeared to her like some sort of animal
and she was afraid of it. Against its wheel
leaned the boy. He was pounding the earth
with a stick and was looking at her. Under
the wagon sat the dog on his haunches. As
soon as he saw her he raised his muzzle and
barked at her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She tried to back into the barn but the man
who stood in its doorway struck her with a
stone which he threw at her. She dashed forward
and reared. Her owner pulled down on
the reins and once more the bend in the centre
of the rider’s bit struck her tender palate.
The pain terrified her. It seemed as if her
enemies were able to strike her from within.
She jumped involuntarily but she realised at
once that every jump inflicted its own punishment.
So she tried very hard to control herself,
though her every nerve was on edge.</p>

<p class='c003'>The man then walked forward and pulled
on the ropes. She did not know what he
wanted, so she braced herself against his pull.
Again he jerked the reins and to avoid the
force of his pull she moved hastily toward
him. At once he moved off again and a few
repetitions of this taught her to follow when
led. Around and around the yard the man led
her and with eyes aflame with fear, her skin
quivering with nervousness, Queen hastily followed
him, desiring to resist but anxiously
afraid to do so.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was beginning to think that that was
all they wanted of her when the man in the
doorway of the barn came forward with a
heavy leather affair from which straps and
things hung and dragged on the ground. She
was standing quite still, breathing rapidly
when this new apparition appeared. As the
man swung it upon her she jumped to the side
in fright. The man at the bridle immediately
jerked the reins and with impatient force.
Her palate by this time was sore and the pain
was so excruciating Queen again lost her temper
and for ten minutes both men were obliged
to hang on the ropes and the reins as she reared
and kicked and balked. But in her enraged
kicking one of her hind legs struck one of the
rear wheels of the wagon and the pain that
shot through her whole body had a quieting
effect upon her. While they had her up
against the wagon from which the boy and the
dog had fled, they placed the saddle upon her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The saddle securely fixed, they led her off
again, but walking was now difficult and painful.
The cinch, the strap that keeps the saddle
in place, was so tight that it was almost
completely hidden by the skin which lopped
over it from both sides. It cut her painfully
every step she took. In two places on her
back some hard parts of the saddle pressed
against the backbone.</p>

<p class='c003'>But all this, miserable as it made her, was
as nothing compared with the horror that
swept over her when the man suddenly seized
the horn of the saddle and threw himself upon
her back like a beast of prey. She sprang
forward to get away from the farmyard; then
on the open prairie she began in real earnest
the attempt to throw him. He pulled on the
reins till she felt the bend in the bit boring
into her tongue. He dug his spurs into her
sides. He lashed her savagely with the knotted
ends of the ropes. But in her desire to
rid herself of the frightful weight she seemed
to have lost her sensitiveness to pain. She
shook her body as a horse will shake water
from him. She reared. She kicked backward.
She shook the rear of her body while
she braced her front legs against the earth.
Then failing in all these attempts, she threw
herself to the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>He jumped in time to avoid a broken leg.
Thinking that she had conquered she struggled
to her feet intending to fly, but to her
consternation, she was no sooner on her feet
than he jumped back upon the saddle. She
was determined to get rid of him and was
about to throw herself again when she received
a blow upon one ear that almost
stunned her. The man had leaned forward
and struck her with his hand in which he held
his hat; but she thought it was some ferocious
bird come out of the air to assist him. She
turned in the opposite direction and dashed
away. When he wanted her to turn back he
struck her on the other ear and this time when
his wing-like hat reached her ear, he sent
forth a most fiendish shriek.</p>

<p class='c003'>Away she leaped over the plains as if some
awful monster were at her heels. She seemed
to get relief in the running. Her rider ceased
pulling on the reins and ceased poking her
sides with his spurs. He showed no displeasure
in any way and Queen began
to realise that that was what he wanted.
When with his reins he pulled her head sideways
she involuntarily turned in that direction
and as soon as she turned he stopped
pulling.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was finally so worn out running, that
she dropped back into a weary walk and as
she looked up she was surprised to find herself
but a few rods from the barn. Rebellion
was futile. All her failures proved it to her,
yet when the man near the barn-door came
forward to take hold of her, she tossed her
head wildly, gripped the bit between her
teeth and reared. Then when he ran off to
the side to get away from her hoofs, she fell
back and rushed for the barn-door.</p>

<p class='c003'>But while her rider drew her head back
till her ears touched him, the man on the
ground hurried over to the barn-door and
seized her by the bridle, holding her till the
man jumped from the saddle. She was glad
to get back into her stall and allowed them
to tie her without a protest. The saddle was
removed from her wet back and sides and the
bit was removed from her blood-stained
mouth.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was dizzy and her heart pounded at her
sides. From her wet distended nostrils the
breath came like the roar of the ocean. Two
sores on her back itched almost unendurably.
Both sides were pierced by the cruel spurs
and blood-stained. An aching pain gnawed
in her palate and she could not throw off the
painful sensation of grating iron from her
teeth. Her body throbbed as a steamer throbs
with the pounding of its engines.</p>

<p class='c003'>They threw hay into her manger but she
only sprang back and looked at them with
moist, glowing eyes. They stopped in front
of her manger and talked. While they talked
she held her terrified eyes upon them, watching
for what they might show evidence of
wanting to do next. In the next stall, the two
big horses, apparently unconcerned about the
weight of harness still on their backs and indifferent
to her troubles, stood with their
greedy heads right over the hay in their manger
and noisily and rapidly ground the hay
in their mouths as if they were afraid that they
would be taken out before they could devour
all that lay before them. When the men
walked into their stall and untying them
started out with them, each one eagerly
stretched his head backward to take a last
large mouthful.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen looked after them as they went
and experienced a sense of relief at their departure,
worried only by the fear that they
would be coming back again. When a few
minutes passed and the doorway remained unobstructed,
she turned her head back again
and sank into a doze which was constantly
disturbed. What troubled Queen most was
the shattered condition of her nerves. The
slightest sound sent her into paroxysms of fear,
making her heart beat with a sense of impending
calamity and sending chills and waves of
heat, by turn, over her body. The voices she
heard coming from the yard oppressed her
with a constant threatening suggestion of the
men’s return.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then, some time later, she became aware of
the fact that the noises were withdrawing.
She heard the wagon rumbling away and even
the barking of the dog grew fainter in the distance.
A sweet silence, as refreshing as the
cold water she longed for, fell upon the little
farmyard; and the feeling of being alone was
like an opiate.</p>

<p class='c003'>But she was suddenly alarmed by the sensation
as of some one present and turning hastily
about, discovered a woman in the doorway
of the barn. Queen was badly frightened.
This creature was different from man but it
was only a different sort of man. She gazed
at the apparition which was talking in a voice
that was softer than that of the men. The
woman was carrying a pail full of water and
came with it to the front of the manger. When
she lifted it to set it down into the manger,
Queen sprang back, frightened.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Drink, Dora, you poor little wild thing,”
said the woman, backing away a bit and looking
at her commiseratingly, “you’re taking it
so hard, you poor little Dora.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Despite her fears, Queen’s ears went up
straight and the glow of fear in her eyes dulled
slightly. The woman went on talking to her
in the same low tones, so different from the
harsh, staccato sounds of the men and the boy.
When the woman went out of the barn Queen
turned her head and looked after her till she
had disappeared. Then she turned to the pail
of water and sticking her burning lips into the
cool liquid she drank without a stop until
there wasn’t a drop of water left.</p>

<p class='c003'>The woman came back again driving a
cow. Behind her, pushing its little muzzle
into her hand, came a little calf. The cow
walked into the stall next to Queen and there,
like the horses, she rummaged about for food.
For some reason known only to the cow, she
did not like the hay that the horses had left,
but cast her cowy eyes upon the hay that was
heaped much higher in Queen’s manger. She
thrust her peculiar wide muzzle between two
beams into Queen’s manger and with her long
tongue gathered some of the hay and pulled
it into her own stall where she chewed it with
apparent great relish. Queen took a mouthful
and chewed it as if the cow had reminded
her of what she ought to do.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Some more water, Dora?” said the woman
coming around to the front again, and as
Queen jumped back frightened, she went on,
“Don’t be afraid of me, Dora. I won’t hurt
you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She took the empty pail and went out with
it, coming back a few minutes later with the
pail refilled and setting it once more into the
manger. She talked to her a few minutes,
then went away. Queen saw her sit down beside
the cow and soon heard the peculiar sound
of milk streams beating against the walls of
a tin pail. She watched her and listened for
a while but since the cow who was most concerned
in the matter seemed not the least worried,
she turned to her water.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the woman was through milking, she
drove out the cow and fed the calf and then
sending it out too, she came back to Queen.
She stood leaning forward against the manger
and talked to her for a long time. There
was something about that voice that made
Queen think of ducks paddling on the surface
of a pond at night, or the songs with which
they sang themselves to sleep. It was a sound
as of birds on branches of trees overhead pushing
into each other and expressing the desire
for warmth or the comfort of having it. The
words followed each other slowly and softly
and there was neither threat nor authority in
them. Queen studied the strange face with the
light playing upon it. She was still slightly
uncertain about the eyes that she was afraid
of and that strangely fascinated her. She was
afraid to look into them, yet there was something
in them that was in a way overcoming
her. Was it the wetness about those eyes that
in some way, perhaps never to be known,
affected Queen? Was it the sympathy that
the suffering have for the suffering that Queen
recognised and that made her blindly place
her hope in this new and mysteriously different
human being?</p>

<p class='c003'>When the woman went out Queen felt as
she had felt on many a winter night in the
wilds when some warm body next to her suddenly
got up and left one side of her disagreeably
cold. For the rest of the afternoon she
kept turning her head toward the doorway
and pricking her ears with more hope than
expectation, and throughout the long disappointing
hours the voice of the woman
poured through her mind like a stream, like
a long persistent melody, and its even flow
was rhythmically measured by the one word
that she remembered most clearly. “Dora!”
What it meant she did not know, but she felt
in a vague way, when she heard it, that it
applied to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Next morning her owner put the saddle on
her again, and though she was very nervous
and afraid and would have fled at the first
real opportunity, the lesson went by without
much of the pain and agony of the first lesson.
She began to understand what every pull of
the reins meant and even the differences she
heard in the man’s voice helped her to avoid
trouble, as for instance, when by the sound of
his voice she knew that he was impatient with
her going too slowly and she sprang forward
into a more rapid gait before the man felt it
necessary to apply the spurs.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the afternoon the woman came into the
barn to give her water and to talk to her.
When she patted her forehead, Queen did
not resist and in time began to crave the touch
of that hand, as she craved the sound of that
voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>Day after day she had her little run over
the fields and as her fear of the farmer lessened
slightly, she began to enjoy the exercise.
It broke the crushing monotony of standing
in the barn and gave her a chance to look at
the plains she loved. So too it gave her a
chance to see the other horses, none of whom
were kept in the barn any longer. She found
that the group in the corral had been very
greatly reduced and the mysterious reduction
worried her. The brown stallion was gone
and with him all the horses she had known,
except the little bay mare, who did not seem
to be on friendly terms with the other two
horses in the corral. She was always off by
herself and at the call of Queen would come
rushing to the wire fence and beg her to join
her.</p>

<p class='c003'>One day the boy jumped upon her back.
The man stood by and watched. The boy
annoyed her by the way he sat and by the way
he held the reins and she could hear the man
angrily instructing him. She could feel him
changing his ways and realised that the man
was taking her part, somehow; but when they
got away off on the fields, he tormented her.
He kept digging his spurs into her sides even
while she was running her best and he pulled
steadily on the reins, hurting her palate and
her lips and making it difficult for her to see
the stone or holes in her path. But much as
she hated and feared this boy, he was as yet
afraid to mistreat her. What he really was
capable of doing to torment her, she was yet
to learn.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old touch of melancholy just barely
perceptible on Queen’s beautiful head deepened
rapidly as submission took possession of
her soul. She learned her lessons hastily and
learned them well for fear of the pain that inevitably
followed mistakes; yet somewhere
in the very heart of that submission crouched
an indestructible hope that sometime, somehow,
she would break the chains of her bondage
and go galloping back to her wilds.</p>

JUST when Dora was resigning herself

of carrying them about in the saddle;
just when she had learned in this state
of her bondage to get from the plains
she would cover, carrying them, that finer sustenance

<p class='c003'>When heavy harness was placed upon her
body, Queen showed her displeasure but
curbed her impulses. The collar and the
hames choked and oppressed her and the
blinders on her bridle tormented and frightened
her. But for something they did which
they did not do for her sake at all, Queen
would have fought as hard as she had fought
when the saddle was first placed upon her.
They had led her out and tied her to a wagon
wheel between two of three horses and she
found herself next to the little bay mare. A
few moments of sniffing noses and Queen
would have endured almost anything rather
than be taken away from her old friend again.
She had been harnessed first and Queen was
willing to tolerate anything she tolerated so
long as she could be there with her; and the
farmer wondered at the constant whinnying
that went on between the two. All the while,
the big horse on the other side of Queen and
the big horse on the other side of the bay mare
stood with their heads at the same level, motionless,
like the mere machines that they were,
awaiting orders to move.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were hitched to a binder and ordered
to move and Queen’s nerves tingled with the
strangeness of the situation. Every move she
made resulted in some disagreeable pull and
the feeling of being trapped, of being held in
on every side was fast arousing her resentment
and the slumbering desire to rebel. But not
only did the weight of the thing they were
dragging subdue that desire, but the horses
on both sides of her seemed to beat into her
soul, with the beating of their hoofs, the utter
hopelessness of showing resentment or attempting
to rebel.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they reached the wheat fields, the
thing grew many times heavier, many times
harder to pull and the deafening noise it made
was distracting to Queen. But the morning
was delightful; the creatures of her own kind
beside her gave her the feeling of having companionship;
and though her muscles found
pulling most arduous, they were still fresh
from a night’s rest. When the morning wore
along toward noon her strength was well nigh
exhausted and the struggle to keep from going
under, stimulated by the whip, suffused her
soul with agony. The day was hot and her
sides dripped with perspiration. The new
harness rubbed her skin in a thousand places
and made her very bones ache. The dust of
the fields and the particles of broken straw
filled the air she breathed and settled down
in her nose and eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>When her aching muscles began to wear out
and the pain she felt frightened her, she tried
to lag a bit but the watchful eye of her owner
soon discovered her lagging and there was a
threatening cry of “Dora!” and the long whip
came down upon her haunches without mercy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Noon came at last. Queen limped on her
way back home, moving along as if the other
horses were carrying her, seeing nothing before
her, feeling only her agony of soul and
body. Painful sores, under rubbing leather
and iron, smarted with the touch of perspiration,
and the hard collar choked her unmercifully.
The weight of the harness seemed to
be pressing her to the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her water she drank at once in great
draughts, but her food she did not touch for
some time and though she stood next to the
little bay mare all through the noon-hour she
did not turn to her once. Her misery was
overwhelming and in its salty waves she was
alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>Though she had not eaten a full meal, she
went back to work just the same and a thousand
times the whip came down upon her back
adding pain as a stimulant, as if she had not
experienced pain enough. When at last the
seemingly endless day came to its close and
the harness was removed, leaving red bloody
sores with rims of black dirt exposed, Queen
lay down at the feet of the little bay mare and
with her eyes closed, lay as if in a stupor for
half the night before she rose to feed her
hunger.</p>

<p class='c003'>Yet when the first few unspeakably torturous
days went by, she seemed to have become
more able to endure the torment. The
stolidity about the old sorrel work-horse and
other work-horses in Queen’s experience,
which she had so often wondered at in her
limited way, now came down like a sort of
mask upon Queen’s head and put a strange
dullness into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>But with the end of the harvest period came
the autumn plowing. Had that been her first
experience she would hardly have lived
through it. It was not only harder work to
drag the plow, that so often struck the rocks
in its path and fairly pulled them from their
feet, but the dust rising in clouds from under
them added to labour and pain the last
ounce of endurable agony. Life to Queen, in
its endless repetition of toil and pain and
abysmal discomfort, relieved periodically by
a few hours’ rest, was not only without purpose
but without excuse. Queen did not reason
her way to such a conclusion, she just felt;
and in this feeling there was not even the light
of illusionary hope. The knowledge that a
given labour will end at a certain time, gave
the hope and the courage to her master which
the strange ruling of life denied to Queen.</p>

<p class='c003'>So Queen lived through the days which she
could not know were ever to end, enduring
labour without compensation, getting food and
water that was not as good as that which
the wilds had lavishly bestowed upon her.
What it was to lead to, she did not know. She
could not even ask. Death was but a nameless
fear and the relief of death was beyond
her understanding. The images of those she
had known and loved in her happier past came
back often in dozing moments, coming into
her dreamy vision as imperceptibly as the evening
comes into the day; and in going they left
in her soul something that resembled hope.
That was all that life offered her and it was
as uncertain as were the whims of the creatures
who dominated and overshadowed her
existence; yet never did she reach a hilltop
from which she caught a glimpse of the open
prairie spaces but the hope that freedom would
come to her expressed itself like a hazy light
in the dark uncertainty that engulfed her.</p>

THE reaping season passed and threshing
time arrived. The farmer was
plowing his fields for the next year’s
seeding because he had finished reaping
before most of the other farmers
had finished. He worked himself as hard as
he worked his “critters.” That was his reputation
among those who did not have anything
more serious against him, but they were few.
Every fall he, like most of the other homesteaders,
left his farm and joined a threshing
crew some twenty miles south, remaining with
it until winter set in and until the wheat of the
last farmer of their circuit had been threshed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Came the last hot spell of the year. Cold
winds and rain and cloud of early autumn
gave way to a short Indian summer, so warm
that insects long too stiff to appear more than
for a few hours during the warmest part of
each day, came buzzing back to life as if it
were springtime. Nose-flies began to bother
the horses and the dirty, old, wire-net nose-baskets
were brought back into use.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sunlit air sponged up the aroma that
oozed from the wet earth, and breathing it
filled Dora with old longing. Sensations of
loping free over the unfenced earth, like
spirits, danced enticingly before her yearning
eyes. Birds flitting through the sweet air sang
with the enthusiasm of spring and urged her
to resist the forces of evil that fettered her.
But the harness on her back was heavy. The
traces that bound her to the plow and the
lines that held her to the others who had forgotten
what freedom is, were inexorable as
the will of the man, whose whip was his only
argument.</p>

<p class='c003'>They had been dragging the unyielding
plow for a few hours on the first of these delightful
mornings, when, looking up as they
turned at the end of a furrow, Dora saw in
the distant south a horse and buggy, coming
at a good pace. All the way down that furrow
she saw the buggy steadily grow larger
and clearer. Coming up on the next furrow
she could see nothing and then as she turned
once more she saw White-black coming. She
stopped for just a second and the whip came
down with a stinging lash. She sprang forward
and pulled along with the rest; but her
head was higher than it had been for some
time and from her trembling lips came nervous
whinnies which White-black did not hear.
By the time the two moving objects met,
there was a long, melodious and very welcome
“whoa,” and the four horses stopped facing
the one horse in the buggy.</p>

<p class='c003'>The three horses relaxed and stood with
heads lowered, grateful for this bit of rest, but
Dora was too excited to stand still. With head
erect, ears pricked she called to her old mate
with a call that shook the whole of her weary
body. White-black raised his head at the
first call, looked at the four horses, sniffed
somewhat like a dog and then with all his
strength, replied. Hardly had he finished
when Dora, exerting herself to the limit of her
strength, called again. White-black started
forward as he replied this time but the impatient
man in the buggy, flaring up with
righteous wrath, cruelly jerked the lines.
White-black raised his head in pain and moved
back a step. He called again but he did not
attempt to go to her any more. His head lowered
like that of the horses beside Dora and
an expression of utter helplessness came over
his white face. Dora, too, dropped her head
with the full realisation of the futility of trying
in any way to overcome the hold man had
upon them.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ploughman left the buggy side where he
had been standing, conversing with the visitor,
and walked back toward his plow a few feet,
then stopped, and continued the conversation.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then I can depend upon you?” said the
man in the buggy.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I’ll unhook right away,” replied the
other, taking out his watch, “and I’ll be there
by supper time. I’ll start just as soon as I
feed the horses and get a bite myself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“All right!” said the stranger, striking
White-black a blow with the whip that sent
him forward at a bound.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dora called after him. From the distance,
even as he was running away at top speed,
White-black called back, helplessly. Dora
tried hard to keep her eyes on the shrinking
buggy and the two white ears that protruded
above it, but her eyes were hemmed in by
the blinders and she found it difficult. She
was obliged to raise her head over the mane
of the little bay mare. Forgetting for the
moment the man at the plow, she rested her
head upon the bay mare’s neck and called and
called again.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a sudden order to move on and
Dora started off, expecting to pull with all
her might upon the traces. She was most
agreeably surprised to find that they had been
unhooked and all the way to the house, stirred
by emotions which she had no other way of
expressing, she pulled ahead of the others,
eager to get to the farmyard as if she expected
to be released there so that she could
go back to the world and the life for which
she longed with old fervour again.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dora was unharnessed and taken to her stall
in the barn. The little bay mare was released
in the corral, while the two big horses with
their harness on were put into the stall next
to Dora and all were fed. In an hour the
farmer was ready to depart. He came into
the barn and took the two horses out, and soon
after, Dora heard the wagon rumbling away.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the last few weeks, throughout the
endless hours of wearing toil, Dora had
yearned for the stall; but now as she stood
there, fresh from the unexpected meeting with
her lifelong companion, the enclosure of the
barn was as harassing as the slavery of harness,
and without knowing why she did it,
realising fully that White-black was far out
of hearing, she called and called like a broken-hearted
mother from whom her foal had been
taken.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her calling was suddenly answered by the
loud voice of the boy, who dashed into the
barn and began quickly to saddle her. He
tightened the cinch, as he always did, till
Dora protested, and then put into her mouth
the rider’s bit with its cruel bend. So, too,
he put on the wire-net nose basket and fastened
it so high that the wire-net pressed against
her lips.</p>

<p class='c003'>As soon as Dora got outdoors she looked
for signs of White-black. When the boy
jumped to the saddle she started away to the
south, but with an angry pull of the reins he
turned her to the west. In spite of the fact
that she had been working to the limit of her
strength, in spite of the pain in her muscles
and limbs, she leaped away like a racer, and
in spite of the fact that she was already going
at her greatest speed, the idiotic boy, as was
his habit, kept applying the spurs. On the
trail along the wire fences she merely tossed
her head with displeasure at every dig, but
when they reached the end of the fences and
he turned her diagonally across the trackless
plains, the sight of the open, unobstructed
prairie helped her to make her show of resentment
plainer.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the stupid boy not only failed to perceive
that he might have been wrong, he resented
what struck him as a challenge to his
authority. He meant to show her that he was
master. He jerked the reins back with all
his might and dug the spurs into her sides.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Go ahead!” he cried when she fled across
the plains as if she had been frightened and
were running away, “You can’t go too fast
to suit me!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Before Dora, as she sped, loomed an exceedingly
large badger hole, the freshly dug, yellow
earth piled high to one side. She was
used to badger holes and had long ago learned
to cunningly avoid them, no matter how suddenly
one appeared in her vision. But despite
his tactics the boy was surprised by
Dora’s unusually nervous behaviour. He was
not at all sure that she wasn’t really trying
to run away. In spite of his fear, he could
not allow himself to dispense with his bullying
proclivities, and as she neared the hole
he turned her head sideways and once more
plied the spurs without reserve.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where she would have, without any difficulty,
avoided it on her own account, his turning
her head drove her upon the mound of
earth. Her leg slipped on the loose, newly-dug
earth and went down the hole and as the
boy attempted to leap from the saddle he was
thrown forward six feet from her head, landing
with a thud and a shriek.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was not badly hurt, but he was so badly
scared that he yelled like a frightened baby.
When he got to his feet there was an expression
of murderous intent on his face and he
stretched his arms forward as he started for
her as if he meant to beat the life out of her
when he got hold of her. But he did not get
hold of her. She had been frightened, too,
and had stood looking at him, unable to decide
what to do; but when she saw those hands,
she reared high into the air in an effort to
prevent his seizing the reins. This time he
backed away afraid of the hoofs that rose
threateningly before him. She turned with
a gracefully defiant toss of her head and
bounded away as fast as the dragging reins
would allow her to go. She could hear his
frantic threatening cries, but that voice had
lost its power. Her chance had come at last!</p>

<p class='c003'>By his futile cries she could tell how far she
was leaving him behind her. She dared not
stop to look back even when she heard his cries
no more. The reins trailing on the ground
impeded her flight and she felt as if he were
but a short distance behind her and would soon
reach her. In her mad race for freedom she
kept stepping on the reins and every step
tore her lips and battered her palate; but not
for a moment did this actually halt her. She
endured the pain like one who was aware of
the fact that the goal was worth it, till all that
was left of the reins dangled a few inches from
her muzzle.</p>

<p class='c003'>A mile farther west from the badger hole
was a patch of woodland. When she reached
it, Dora stopped for a second to look back;
but she did not see the boy. A hill, in between,
obstructed her view. She felt somewhat
freer not seeing him; but still she went
as fast as she could go working her way
through the woods. The branches of the
trees caught in her saddle and made going
very fast impossible. Twigs hooked in the
ring of the bit outside of the basket and not
only hurt her but frightened her because
sometimes she had sensations of being seized
by some man. But despite these pulls and
digs and impediments, dodging the branches
as best she could, she came in half an hour
to a large open space. Two or three miles
beyond that she saw another patch of woods
and headed straight for that. She got through
this bit of woodland without much trouble
and reaching another open space she followed
the wall of trees in its irregular curve
to the north.</p>

<p class='c003'>Still northward she fled, though the north
had failed her. It was evening, when after
a steady trot for twenty-five miles she came
to the strip of forest that borders upon the
Saskatchewan and there, coming upon a deer
path which was familiar to her, she plunged
into the shadows of the woods. She was too
tired and still too weary of pursuit to think
of food. Coming to a windfall where she
had many a time successfully hidden in the
days before her captivity, she lay down to
rest.</p>

<p class='c003'>She had been down but a short time
when the prodding of the hard wooden stirrup
upon which she was lying forced her up. She
tried to lie down again, but again the stirrup
forced her to get up. Again and again she
tried it, but each time with the same result,
and finally with the growing fever of a new
and threatening fear, she gave up the attempt
to rest and went instead for a drink of water
at the river. When she reached the river’s
edge she stopped to stare across to the wilds
beyond. There was a wish in her heart that
she could find some way of getting across the
moving water, but that wish was dulled by a
vague realisation of the fact that now, without
her old followers, getting across would
not be wholly satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c003'>A great sad stillness brooded over the river,
hanging over the silvery reflections of the sky-line
like a dome of mist that rested upon the
dreary shadows of the trees and banks on each
side. Confinement and toil had sickened
Dora’s love of the wilds, though memory
sought to exalt it as of old, and the beauty of
the wilderness, without her companions, was
only desolation. A nameless longing in her
heart and a complexity of fears she had never
experienced before seized upon her like a disease.
It was as if she expected a fatal blow
from some hidden enemy that moved about
her in every possible direction.</p>

<p class='c003'>She bent down and drank at her feet. It
was hard and disagreeable to drink with the
wire-net on her muzzle and the iron bit in
her mouth. She lashed the fast flowing
stream with her muzzle in the hope that somehow
the nasty basket would be washed away
by the water, but she gave up the attempt and
drank as best she could. Suddenly she lifted
her head and stared away into the dark spaces.
In the far distance a small shadowy form
swooped from the top of a tall poplar, like
a bit of shadow breaking away from the body
of the night, and disappeared in the whiteness
of the sky, leaving behind the melancholy
echo of its cry. She followed it with her eyes
till it was no more visible, then suddenly
turned and ran for the open.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not only the open prairie she sought,
because the open prairie was the world she
knew and loved best; but something else was
driving her. A fear that seemed to have been
born of shadow and water and the lonely cry
of the loon. It was the sudden realisation that
though she had escaped from the detestable
slavery of man and toil and dirty barn, she
had carried away from her bondage man’s
inescapable curse.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her first act upon reaching the open was
to search the shaded distances, then out of the
depths of her embittered, fear-infested heart,
she sent into the wilds she had longed for her
earnest appeal for companionship; but only
the mocking echo of her own voice came back
from the motionless tree-walls on each side of
her. She lowered her head to graze but raised
it at once again. Now she knew what she
had feared. Now she grasped something of
the extent of man’s curse. The wire-net on
her muzzle, like a trap, forbade her to eat
until she returned humbly to man and submitted
to his tyranny.</p>

<p class='c003'>In a frenzy of fear and anger she loped
about in a circle for the greater part of an
hour, then she attempted to rub the cursed
thing from her lips. But rubbing on the
ground pushed back the levers of the rider’s
bit and hurt her with every move. She
stopped to think a moment, gazing helplessly
about. She lowered her head, pushing it
along between her hoofs, and pulling it forward,
trying to rub it off that way; but all
that she did was to bend the strong wire of
the basket, which after that pressed painfully
into her nose. She tried rubbing her muzzle
against the bark of a tree. A small twig point
pierced the skin of her lip and as she hastily
pulled her head back the lever of the bit
caught in some way and she struggled for
some time before she freed it. Then she gave
up, running off into space as if she were trying
to flee from some fearful thing she had
just seen.</p>

<p class='c003'>The cinch was still tight and though it did
not bother her much when she was up on her
feet, it seemed to grow tighter and cut into
her skin when she tried to lie down; and if,
for want of rest, she lay down anyway, the
stirrups always fell in such a way as to press
into some tender spot as she lay upon one of
them. She would endure that for a few minutes
and then she would get up again with a
groan.</p>

<p class='c003'>The poplar woods about the Saskatchewan
are not continuous. Patches and strips covering
spaces of from one to fifty acres cut up
the rolling plains. By running round about
these she could keep herself invisible to approaching
enemies. Her old power to detect
man’s approach seemed to come back to her.
Once that day she thought she detected some
one coming, and hid in the trees without even
making sure, then coming out on the other side
and taking a roundabout run, left that section
of the country. Yet as she hastily put
distance between herself and this danger, she
half realised that she might have to go back
at last to the man from whom she had escaped,
who she knew could save her from the
iron grip on her muzzle. Two days later she
saw some one coming on the eastern horizon.
She was certain that it was the boy pursuing
her and first going north to get under cover of
a patch of woods, she fled west for many miles.</p>

<p class='c003'>She came late in the afternoon to the pond
in the wilderness where White-black had
been trapped in the mud. She remembered
clearly White-black’s floundering in the mud
and avoided that side of the pond. She
walked leisurely around it, gazing over the
silent water from whose brightness she missed
the remembered sight of ducks. Many a time
in her slavery she had had visions of this bit
of water with its reflections smiling up to the
heavens. It seemed hard for her to believe
that she was really there. She had longed so
often to be there; yet, now, she experienced
something like a feeling of disappointment.
What it was or why, she did not know.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was crossing a muddy spot when she
slipped and fell on her side. She was not
hurt but slightly stunned and remained lying
down. As she lay there it occurred to her
that the stirrup was not hurting her. She did
not think of its sinking into the mud, but
thenceforth when she wanted to lie down she
came to that muddy spot. The pond came to
her assistance in another way. She had gone
in some distance to get a drink of clear water
where the pond bottom was quite hard and as
she drank, some of the lower rushes penetrated
the basket through the meshes of the
net. She lowered her muzzle carefully, keeping
her jaws open; and when she felt some
of the rushes in her mouth, she cropped them
quickly, chewing them triumphantly as the
water dripped from her muzzle.</p>

<p class='c003'>The rushes grew tallest in the centre of the
pond. She was afraid to go in very far, feeling
constantly, as she would move inward,
that this time she was going to stick there. It
was not long before what rushes she could
reach had all been cropped. She learned to
get some grass by doing with the grass what
she had done with the rushes, but though this
was better food she could not get as much of
the grass as she had gotten of the rushes. She
managed in that way, however, to keep life
burning in her bedraggled body.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fear of being pursued and captured
again left her as the days went by without
a sign of man, but as this fear left came hunger.
All day she struggled to obtain enough
grass to keep her alive and when the stirrup
resting on frozen mud kept her awake at
night, she only thought of grass and how to
get more and more of it. The sweetness of
the wilds she had loved was gone, leaving
them hollow and desolate and so cruelly unresponsive
as to be almost mocking.</p>

<p class='c003'>Day after day man’s curse grew heavier to
bear and the strangle-hold it had upon her life
contracted with more telling effect. It was
only a matter of a short time when its contracting
hold would finally and mercifully put
an end to her misery.</p>

<p class='c003'>The short Indian summer passed away.
The nights became cold and the frosts froze
the mud into rock. When in lying down
the stirrup pressed into some tender spot, she
would endure the pain, then rise next morning
and go limping over the plains. A layer of
thick ice which no longer melted by the middle
of the day now covered the pond. What little
frozen dew that she could get, with the little
grass she could crop, only intensified her thirst
and the desire for water drove her to desperation.
She tried to break a hole in the ice but
she did not have the necessary strength. The
irresistible desire for water sent her out upon
the slippery ice in the hope of finding a weaker
spot. A dozen feet from the edge she slipped
and fell with a crash, breaking through and
falling into the icy water. She was obliged to
rest a while before she could summon enough
energy to get up. When she did get up she
was aching from head to foot and on her leg
was an open, bleeding wound. She drank, however,
all she could hold, then she turned and
looked helplessly to the shore, afraid to step
over the broken ice, falling again when at last
she ventured toward it, but finally getting
back.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her sides pained her terribly and her open
wound smarted and itched. She tried to lick
it but only hurt it with the wire-net. She
stood stolidly for a few moments, her addled
brain trying to clarify the great confusion that
came over it. What was she to do? What was
going to become of her? Life was almost unendurable,
and instincts of terrifying force
guarded against the death that would have relieved
her. Paroxysms of fear swept over
her, filling the shadows of the desolation with
beasts of prey who, leering and licking their
chops, waited with terrifying patience for the
weaker moment when they expected to pull
her down.</p>

<p class='c003'>Geese flew southward constantly and their
ominous honking sang dirges to the death of
all that life had been to her in its happier
past. The skies grew grey and remained
chronically grey and the atmosphere seemed
filled up with a great cosmic sorrow, like the
face of a child suppressing the impulse to cry.
The winds reaching out from the frozen north
wailed with maddening grief.</p>

<p class='c003'>A taciturn old coyote began to worry her.
He would sometimes pass her while she
grazed or struggled in her attempts to graze,
each time seemingly coming nearer. He filled
her soul with terror. Sometimes he woke
her at night with his demoniac howling and
she would spring to her feet and shake and
tremble with fear and cold, only to find that
he was sitting on the rim of the hollow, looking
down at her, his black, hateful form cut
clearly against the dark grey sky. Then one
morning, she awoke to find him less than a
rod away, sitting on his haunches and watching
her. He fled when she sprang weakly
toward him with a fearful cry in which she
tried desperately to be defiant; but she decided
then to abandon the horror-infested
basin.</p>

<p class='c003'>The great weakness was upon her. The
coyote had long recognised it and she knew
it now. Whither she was to go or what she
was to do, she did not know. Only she felt
the need of going and she went, limping
slowly and painfully, sick in body and soul,
all her defiance of man crushed out of her.
Thus the erstwhile Queen of the wilds lumbered
painfully over the plains that seemed
to no longer sustain her, going humbly back
to man to dumbly beg for mercy, for even in
that state of mind she felt that as man had
placed his curse upon her only man could remove
it.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a dreary, dull afternoon. The sun
struggled to show itself and its weakest
warmth was driven from her protruding
bones by a cold, cutting gale. In her lumbering
along over the plains that seemed
strangely dim and uncertain she stopped every
once in a while and stared like a decrepit old
woman. She came at last to an open space
between two patches of woodland and stopped
to gaze wild-eyed upon a black shanty covered
with tar-paper, and a sod barn.</p>

<p class='c003'>The smells that came from that farmyard
made it very hard for her to advance, but the
intense feeling of her desperation conquered
each wave of fear and step by step she made
her way toward the house, stopping at last,
a hundred feet away, unable to go any farther.
There was no sign of life. Fear held her
motionless yet hunger and thirst and weakness
urged her to call for help. Her call
sounded weak and hollow. She called again
with greater exertion and in that call a note
of conciliation was unmistakably audible.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly she saw the door of the shanty
open and a woman came out. Had it been a
man, all her unworded resolution would have
gone to naught and Dora would have turned
and fled; but a woman was a different experience.
She turned nervously and walked off
a short distance, but when the woman advanced
toward her holding out a hand and
calling with a most winning voice, she
stopped and waited. When the woman came
nearer Dora heard her own name. The recognition
of that sound gave her so much hope
and courage that she deliberately turned toward
the woman who by that time was near
enough to take hold of one of the pieces of
strap that still hung from the bit-ring.</p>

<p class='c003'>For a few minutes the woman patted her
forehead lovingly and talked to her in a way
that warmed poor Dora as if the woman had
placed a blanket over her cold aching body.
When the woman began leading her toward
the house she followed willingly till the door
opened and a little girl came out, then she
stopped as if afraid; but when the woman
urged she went on, keeping her eyes upon the
little girl.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the well, the little girl chopped a hole in
the ice on the trough while the woman
removed the basket, bridle, halter and what
was left of the saddle and Dora lowered her
head quickly into the water and drank as rapidly
as she could.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That dirty brute!” said the woman.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He never feeds his critters,” piped in the
little girl.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He doesn’t feed his wife,” added the
woman, not because she wanted to tell this
to the little girl, but rather because she wanted
to express the hatred of an old and bitter feud.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Take these rotten things,” said the woman,
pointing to the bridle and the halter, while
she seized the remains of the saddle. “Let’s
get them out of the way, and don’t you ever
open your mouth to tell any one, no matter
who it is, that his mare was here. I don’t
want his rotten old saddle and bridle. He
never keeps anything looking decent enough
for any one to want any of his rotten things.
Anyway it is a sin to send this poor mare back
to him. It ain’t up to me to catch his runaway
critters for him and I just can’t let the poor
critter go off like this and die. When Dad
gets back from threshin’, he’ll take these
things and drop ’em on the road near his place
where he will be sure to find them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When Dora had drunk all she could, she
turned immediately to some grass near by and
began voraciously to pull at it. The woman
had befriended her and she was not afraid of
her.  But to her surprise, when she came
back, the woman rushed at her with something
in her hand which she waved threateningly at
her, clearly ordering her away. Dora ran off
as fast as she could go and when she got well
out of the way, she turned to look back with a
puzzled expression on her face. Both the
woman and the little girl were calmly entering
the shanty.</p>

<p class='c003'>Without an attempt to get at the motive
behind the woman’s strange conduct, Dora
went on grazing there, moving off and looking
back when her mouth was too full to crop,
eating so rapidly and so absorbedly that she
had no time to think about the phenomenal
change that had thus miraculously come over
her. If she was not thinking gratefully, she
did feel grateful and possibly some higher
intellectual force than hers, in some way,
realised for her that only justice had been
done.</p>

</div>
<div class='c016'>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
FOR several days after the woman had
relieved her of the racking burden of
straps and iron and wire-net, Dora
was troubled by the conflict of recurrent
impulses to go back to the farm
yard and the fears that just as ardently urged
her to get far out of the reach of man. Months
of arduous toil followed by weeks of semi-starvation
had robbed her of her strength and
her courage; the barn had so enervated her
that she found the cold, out doors, especially
at night, very hard to endure; and her captivity
had deprived her of her companions
without whom life was not worth the struggle.</p>

<p class='c003'>One snow flurry followed another. The
last spot of exposed earth disappeared. The
sun did not show itself for days and every
hour seemed to deepen the drifts. Never had
the world seemed so bleak and inhospitable
to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was so miserably cold one windy night
that she decided at last to go back to the
farmyard where she had been so magnanimously
befriended. She got up toward the end
of the long night and started away, lumbering
along for many miles in the dark, driven by
the image of the sheltering barn; and then she
stopped suddenly as the other image, that of
the woman driving her away, came into her
mind. She stood still, unable to decide what
to do and as she stood the reddish streak in the
south east grew brighter and less red.</p>

<p class='c003'>She became very cold, having stood so long,
and started off again more for want of exercise
than through any definite decision, and
as she neared the top of a wild rose bush that
protruded from a deep drift, a rabbit sprang
out of its shadow and bounded away to the
south. Dora stopped through momentary
fright, and followed him with her eyes as he
fled. She missed him when he was swallowed
up in the great ocean of whiteness and searching
for him suddenly discovered a group of
horses on the ridge of a long hill, their dark
bodies cut clearly against the end of the light
streak in the sky.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dora did not stop for her breakfast. Her
eyes lighted up, her nostrils distended and her
thin legs plowed through the snows as if their
old strength had fully come back to them.
There were many hills and valleys lost to the
sight in the level whiteness and, crossing them
over-anxiously, she was obliged to stop a few
times to rest and to regain her breath, before
at last she reached the horses, by that time
down the side of the hill.</p>

<p class='c003'>There were about a dozen of them spread
out considerably. While yet some distance
from them, she thought she recognised some
of her old friends, but as she came nearer she
was overwhelmed with doubt. They were
pawing the snow very energetically and took
little interest in her fervent greetings. One
or two heads raised up a moment, then went
back to the business of finding grass which
the rest would not interrupt even for that short
time. This reception was a great disappointment
to Dora, but there were other disappointments
in store for her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The three horses to whom she was nearest,
watched her approach with suspicion. They
were, all three, hard working horses, who
found the pawing of snow a laborious task.
They thought she meant to eat from their find
and drove her off with threats of angry whinnies
and laying ears. One of them, a miserable
old nag, a red mare with two naked scars
on her shoulders, jumped across the hole she
had dug, ran after Dora and nipped her
haunches several times, as poor Dora fled
from her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dora stopped running about a hundred
yards from there, looked back at the old nag
and, seeing that she had returned to pawing,
began to paw the snow where she was. When
she got to the grass and had taken a mouthful,
she raised her head and stared at the group,
wondering what had happened to the beautiful
world from which she had been abducted by
man. She could not make out why that old
nag had been so intent upon hurting her.
Dora did not know of those differences in
temperament which makes one creature
mellow and sympathetic after an experience
of great suffering and another sour and
pugnacious.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her reception was a sad disappointment to
Dora, but even that companionship was better
than none. So she clung to it with all her
strength, content to move about on the outer
edge of the group. When the herd had fed
well and for exercise started across the snows,
Dora always went with them, running with
every ounce of energy in her body, striving
through her old revived habit to get to the
lead; but Dora soon realised that these were
not the days of her supremacy. Strive as she
would, she could not keep up with even the
poorest plug and long before the others were
ready to quit, she was obliged to drop out of
the race, humiliated and unhappy, puffing and
panting for breath.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, she took part in every race.
Every time she made the same strenuous
attempt to do the impossible. The youngsters
of two and three years of age fairly laughed
at her, reaching her while she struggled with
might and main and leaving her behind with
a few easy bounds. But it is a poor effort that
accomplishes no result whatever, and though
she could at no time outrun the younger
horses, she daily managed to leave some older
horse behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>One day she tried her old trick. Very early
in the race she happened to be in the lead,
having started the race. When the younger
horses saw her leading a few of the old plugs,
they started after her, soon, of course, overtaking
her. Dora swerved to the side, in the
hope that they would follow her, and found
herself alone. They not only refused to follow
her but they did not even look back to
see what had happened to her. Dora was so
unhappy she started off again after them, but
soon stopped, realising that she could not
catch up to them and that she would soon be
out of breath once more. She stood still a
while and watched them enviously. Then she
turned, intending to paw the snow for grass,
when she saw another group of horses coming
from the southeast.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dora raised her head and looked with
absorbed interest. The wind lifted her mane
and fluttered it gracefully in the air. For a
few moments, absorbed in the creatures that
moved toward her in single file, she looked
like Queen once more in all the glory of her
regency. When they were a hundred yards
away, Queen neighed with all her strength.
At once the marching line stopped and all
heads went up high in the air. Then from
the rear of the line a white horse broke from
the path he had been following and with a call
of recognition started hastily toward her. It
was White-black and, with a strength born
of the very sight of him, Queen loped to meet
him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Four of the other horses recognized her,
too, and the air vibrated with the music of
that happy reunion. Noses touched noses and
happy whinnies greeted happy whinnies.
With the five of them had come a young
mother, a sorrel mare with a fuzzy little colt
who had been born in the spring. When the
others had gone to meet Queen she remained
in her tracks, hesitating to get into any kind
of an assembly where through joy or anger her
colt might be hurt. He stood right behind
her, his fuzzy little head against her haunch,
his eyes filled with wonderment.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Dora had greeted her old friends, she
went to greet the mother and her colt, running
her old muzzle, on which were still the marks
of her struggle with the basket, down the
fuzzy little fellow’s forehead, murmuring
tremulously. The proud young mother
looked on almost eagerly and commented
softly and good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c003'>But when the big group returned there was
dissention at once. The ugly red mare
seemed to think that there was entirely too
much fuss made over Queen, and turned upon
her with open mouth. White-black, right
behind the old nag, nipped her severely. A
quarrel followed which spread to the rest of
the group and finally ended in a race which
divided the two groups, Dora going off with
her friends. All day the two groups dug the
snow a goodly distance apart and in the evening
came the worst storm of the season.</p>

<p class='c003'>The storm approached quite suddenly,
though all day there had been vague signs of
its coming. A northern gale blew up, tearing
the weaker branches from the trees and
sending them sliding over the surface of the
snow, tearing up the looser snow and blowing
it into their eyes and ears and nostrils. Queen
led her group to a fairly sheltered spot in
among the trees near by and together they
lay down.</p>

<p class='c003'>The warmth of their bodies, one touching
the other, was so comforting that the slightest
move on the part of any one of them brought
a low, patient protest from the rest. The
night came rapidly. The wind grew more
and more furious, howling and shrieking
overhead, and the tall poplars groaned as they
bent with its lashing. Gusts of wind, loaded
with snow, which it raised on the open, struck
the trees and the snow fell in powder upon
them below, covering them as with a blanket.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the open the savage north wind went
mad. It tore along at a terrific rate, taking
everything that was loose with it, then, as if
it had in its savage eagerness fallen over itself,
there was a pause for a moment, after which,
picking itself up again, it went on with even
greater ferocity, shrieking as with some
ineffable, primordial pain. It seized the fallen
snow and whirled it around with the falling
snow, scattered it high in the air, lifting it
again when it had fallen and sending it like
waves across the plains, gathering great
showers of it and hurling them against the
wall of the woods, sending these showers down
upon the tree tops, tearing it all up again as
soon as it had fallen into drifts below and
once more hurling the restless dust into space—a
display of insane, futile effort—a cosmic
passion bereft of purpose.</p>

<p class='c003'>But if this wild night could have been
wilder and had raved with even more threat
in its raving, it could not have diluted the contentment
in Queen’s heart. The touch and
the subtler feeling of the presence of her companions
did as much to keep her warm as the
heat of their bodies, and, like a light, illumined
the long trail of life behind her. She
moved through the corridor of her past like
a curious child, walking in its sleep and
dreaming of a beautiful, incoherent fairyland.
The light was silvery as that of the moon and
in the shadows detached images which she
only half recognised glistened like reflections
on the snow. And when dawn ushered in a
calm day, Queen rose with a feeling like that
of having returned home from a long visit
and shook the snow from her body.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen knew the country there as none other
knew it. Leading the little group to the best
feeding grounds, she took her place once more
at the head, for at the head only could Queen
be happy. In spite of the deep snows through
which they were obliged to plow to get their
food, Queen began to fill out rapidly and the
greater part of her old strength came back to
her. With the return of her strength came
the old fear of man. Every move was accompanied
by an investigation and in every sound
of wind and tree she seemed to hear the sound
of a voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>There followed a long period of fair
weather in which the snows hardened and
shrank and then one day, as they were digging
for grass, they were surprised by three men
on horseback on a hill to the south and east,
less than a quarter of a mile away. The
horsemen had come upon them so suddenly
that Queen, confounded, stood looking at them
a few minutes, transfixed with fear. She
recognised the man who had captured her on
the big horse that had worked beside her in
the plow. Next to him was the boy on the
little bay mare and his cry of “There she is!”
fully aroused Queen.</p>

<p class='c003'>The little herd, however, had no difficulty
in getting away from them, because they had
no burdens on their backs and they were now
more used to the deep snows on the open
plains than the horses that were chasing them.
The horsemen kept behind them for a long
while and then disappeared. But Queen was
too wise to end her flight there. She knew
that even though the men gave up the chase
that day they would appear again the next, or
soon after that.</p>

<p class='c003'>Out of the misery and discomfort of her
captivity she had just emerged. She had
found her companions and the life for which
she had hungered all through those unhappy
months. Hardly had she realised the full
extent of her good fortune when man reappeared
to take it all away from her. But
Queen was in no submissive mood. She had
fought for her freedom and she would fight
again. She would watch with such care that
she would not again be caught at a disadvantage.
She hardly gave herself time to eat.
Her ears were constantly pricked high. Her
eyes, afire with her emotions, never for a
moment abandoned their vigilance. But her
nervous dread of man soured the sweetness of
the wilds and Queen moved over the snows
with the old feeling of the trap beating in
her heart, moved without resting and, out of
habit, moved northward.</p>

<p class='c003'>They came next day to the strip of woodland
whose heroic poplars silently guard the
Saskatchewan. There they stopped and there
the full horror of the trap took possession of
Queen. She was afraid of her own shadow
and the slightest sound startled her. A partridge
drumming in the woods sent her madly
loping through space.</p>

<p class='c003'>The winter evening came early. The distant
sun lowered in the southwest with a sad,
yellow glare; and in the north a gleaming,
pearly streak foretold a brilliant display of
northern lights. That streak interested Queen
and she watched it as the darkness thickened,
and as she watched it, looking up from time
to time, it grew brighter. Faint shimmering
colours appeared at the eastern end of the
streak and slowly moved across it to the
west, vanishing in the west and reappearing
brighter in the east. Many times she had seen
these lights, but only once, somewhere in her
half-forgotten childhood, had she seen them
so bright and so fascinating.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were standing directly in front of a
cleft in the shadowy wall of trees. The cleft
led like a roadway to the banks and the river
below. There they could see more of the
lights, the portion that glowed in the lower
part of the sky and danced about over the
shadowy tops of the trees on the other shore.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was during a moment when the lights
were so compelling that all of them had
stopped to look when there appeared in the
cleft the giant body of a moose, his antlers
like a magnificent oak cut clearly against the
scintillating colours of the aurora borealis.
His coming had been so swift, so sudden and
so imperceptible that it took them some time to
realise that a living thing stood within a few
yards of them, looking at them. The herd
hastily retreated a short distance; but as soon
as they stopped to look back the enormous
animal got frightened, turned and vanished
down the banks.</p>

<p class='c003'>Queen was very curious. She trotted carefully
after him and the rest of the herd kept
to her tracks. When Queen’s head appeared
where the plains turn over the banks, the
moose looked up at her a moment and then
like a rabbit shot straight across the river.
Beyond the centre of the frozen river he
stopped for a moment to look back once more,
then leaped on and vanished in the woods
beyond, leaving behind him, across the ice of
the erstwhile invincible Saskatchewan the
defiant shadow of his trail.</p>

<p class='c003'>An overwhelming impulse flared up in
Queen’s soul. A great confusion of fear and
hope seized upon her heart. So nervous that
every muscle in her body trembled, she made
her way down the banks and with infinite fear
and caution she took the trail of the moose.
She walked along slowly and very carefully
and stopped often to take bites of the snow on
the ice as if she were testing it and at the same
time trying to quench the fires that were burning
within her. The others hesitated a
moment, but when they saw her nearly half
way across, they faithfully followed her.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the woods north of the river, they
camped for the night. Next day they went
on, penetrating the woods and following the
trail of the moose till they came upon an open
space a mile beyond the river. There they
remained for the rest of the winter, feeding
upon grass the like of which they had only
at rare times come upon.</p>

<p class='c003'>Succeeding snowfalls covered their tracks
and when spring came, melting the snows and
filling the desolate hollows with quivering,
rippling ponds, loading the lonely air with
the whir of duck wings and the happier honking
of geese, the roar of the swollen Saskatchewan
had placed the final seal upon their
emancipation.</p>

<p class='c003'>And here the story of Queen Dora must
end, for in that new world beyond the trail
of the moose her struggle against the usurpation
of man was over. It was long after her
generation that man ventured into that desolate
region where she found perfect happiness,
as perfect a happiness as may come to living
things. Grass and water, leisure and activity,
companionship and security, these were all
Queen asked of life, and these were as free
in those unfenced wilds as the air and as limitless
in their abundance. No enemies, no contention,
preferences without hatred, joyous
play and eternal good will, she looked toward
each coming moment with no fear; while the
glowing sensations of fading yesterdays only
sweetened the music of her existence.</p>
